I've always driven past it and wondered what it was like, but since she gave it such a great review, I thought I'd give it a go. 

The restaurant has a sort of Parisian cafe feel to it, with mismatched chairs and some booths and tables, and a mural on the wall. Upon arrival mid-Saturday afternoon, we were also presented with 3 menus, breakfast (which was ending shortly), sandwiches and another menu which appeared to be dinner options, priced $16 - $24 range. My friend and I both selected from the sandwich menu. 

I ordered the BLT, but having noticed that they served peameal bacon for breakfast, asked if I could have peameal on my BLT, they obliged, no problem. My friend ordered the meat loaf sandwich and we both ordered the sweet potato fries. 

Service was fast, there were only 2 other occupied tables in the restaurant. I was expecting an average sandwich, didn't really figure you can screw up a BLT, er...thought wrong. The peameal was overcooked, and very dry, and it was served on 'white' bread, no egg or challah bread to be found here!! I was disappointed. The whole sandwich was dry, I asked for mayo, and the waiter said there was already mayo on it, I opened it up and the thing was bare. I showed him, and said, ""Umm, actually there's not..."" (awkward...) 

My friend's meatloaf sandwich was a mess!! First she had asked for no onions, was allergic to them, and upon receiving the sandwich, had to proceed to pick off somewhere in the range of 7-8 pieces of red onion off of her sandwich!! The problem with the sandwich was just that it was a complete mess. It was on a regular bun, and gravy was poured over the meatloaf and the other half of the bun was placed on top. On service, the bottom part of the bun, is soaked, drenched in gravy, making it impossible to pick up! It was just a mess, I think it would be a much more successful item choice if perhaps it was served as an open faced meat loaf sandwich, with the gravy in a boat on the side that you pour on yourself at the time you are going to eat it, so that the bottom bun doesn't disintegrate. 

As if our food quality wasn't bad enough while we were attempting to salvage a meal out of it, our entertainment was listening to our waiter bicker with the other waitress about table assignment and allocation of tips and how unfair she had been. The disagreement got quite heated and their voices were raised, creating quite a bit of tension in the restaurant amongst the customers, or at least, that was my perception. 

Overall, I was not impressed with the food or the service of this restaurant. I would not recommend it. I will not be returning to try their breakfast or brunch, or even to give it a second chance. Unfortunately, that was my very first and last visit. You know what they say, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.",1

We decided to order calamari with tomato sauce. It was brought out in 35 minutes without tomato sauce. After asking for the tomato sauce, it took another 10 minutes to get it. But I have to say the calamari was probably the only decent thing about this night. We got our food shortly after. I ordered the goat cheese ravioli with smoked salmon. I'm 99% sure that there was little to no goat cheese in my ravioli as it had the taste and texture of ricotta cheese...something you'd pick up frozen at the grocery store. I also had to search for any pieces of smoked salmon as they were miniscule and few and far between. Overall, I've had store bought pasta much better than that. My boyfriend ordered the New York striploin which was supposed to come with tempura onion rings...there were none to be seen. The cut of the steak was completely wrong and the whole middle of the steak was all gristle. He also asked for sauce on the side and his steak was completely coated in it.

She would walk by us continuously and ignore us. We had a coupon for the restaurant which is another reason why we decided to try it, and both waitresses tried to short change us on the value of it, finally after telling them 3 times what needed to be done, they got it right.The service here was atrocious, the food was seriously lacking, especially for the price, the atmosphere was alright however it was freezing because it was cold and drafty.I'd never waste my time going here again and would warn other people about going there.

I asked the hostess about seating in the restaurant as I had reserved and she said it was full. She offered to move us to another table in the bar, ut it was closer to the live music and would have been even noisier.
We ordered some drinks and I was confronted with a bottle of beer, with no glass. There was nothing fine dining about the atmosphere or he service. It was a bar room experience at fine dining prices.
The food was the only thing left to rescue the evening and it was a disaster. I ordered the pork tenderloin which was so overcooked that I thought they has served a pork chop with the bone in. It was also flavorless and burnt. My dining companions also expressed great disappointment with their meals, using terms like flavorless, over-cooked and cold.

I usually have a 3 strikes and you're out policy... If this were a baseball game, the Red Martini's winning streak would be in the negatives!

It was my high school English teacher's birthday and because she lives I'm the Durham Region we usually dine somewhere in Pickering or Ajax. It gets me out of Toronto once in awhile.  So I had made reservations for 7pm. When we arrived there were 2 occupied tables in the downstairs bar lounge.  We stood there for 5 minutes with no sign of any hostess or staff.  After what seemed like an eternal wait, the waitress appeared and she told us we could choose a table either upstairs or downstairs.  We opted for the upper level.

The Red Martini is a house-converted restaurant, similar to 22 Church Street Bistro across the street.  A co-worker told me that the 2 restaurant are owned by the same owner, however this is unconfirmed.  However I did spot a lot of similarities.

Once we chose our table, again we were left unattended and ignored for awhile. We quickly realized that the waitress who ""greeted"" us downstairs was the only staff in the front end for the entire restaurant. Strike 1 - understaffed.

My high school English teacher loves her white wine and she usually orders the house white.  Strike 2 - they were out of their house white.  This is a clear indication of poor restaurant management.  So we had no other choice than to order the next available white wine which was twice the cost.

We waited for our appetizer - no bread basket appeared - Strike 3 and you're out! 

We ordered and shared the Stuffed Portobello Mushroom Salad to start. This could've easily been THE best tasting salad I've ever had in my life. However, the minor neglect in detail made it second best.  The salad was a deconstructed-style salad. The grilled portobello mushrooms were delicious. The ""stuffing"" was made from imitation crab meat and eggs... So essentially it tasted like an egg salad.  It was also served with COLD naan bread... It would've been the perfect salad if they grilled the naan. We had requested that the appetizer come first and then our mains... However the server showed up 2 minutes into us digging into our salads, so we had to send her back to the kitchen and requested the food be kept warm.

My Coconut Tilapia was served with a spicy plum sauce, Bok Choy, red and yellow bell peppers and jasmine rice. When I first bit into the tilapia I was excited that the fish skin was so crisp... But I quickly realized that the crisp was not due to skillful culinary execution, but rather to a burnt fish... Parts of it were so burnt I started tasting charcoal!  Also, the ""coconut"" component of the dish was M.I.A.  This dish had so much potential.. *sigh*

I didn't try my teacher's Veggie Stir-Fry with Chicken but the feedback I got from her wad that the vegetables were cooked to a mush, and that the chicken was dry.  In their defense, the mush factor may have been a result of the dish being kept on a warming plate.

To finish we ordered a cappuccino, tea and marbled cheesecake.  The server came back up to inform me that they don't offer cappuccino... How do you not know that?  Its like she was a temp hired to tide over a quiet Sunday restaurant service.  So I settled for a coffee.  

The cheesecake was average, nothing spectacular.  

At the end of the day, the bill came to $105.  I will say that the portion sizes are generous and the food does have potential... However, the service aspect is going to need a complete facelift.  I had such high hopes for you Red Martini... I thought you'd be sizzling... But unfortunately the only thing that was red and sizzling about my experience at the Red Martini was my dress and the afterburn in my mouth from the spicy plum sauce!",2

The tortilla was cold (what?) and the ""shredded beef"" was more like beef chunks.  The iceberg lettuce was an unwelcome surprise.  Black beans.... I hate black beans.  I guess it was wrong to assume they would be pinto or refried.  The chipotle sauce wasn't spicy at all and just added a burnt flavor.

Also, on the weekends, in the morning, they have a ""breakfast bar"", a buffet of typical breakfast items, including eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, pancakes, waffles, corned beef hash and an assortment of fruit.

Their NY Strip steaks seem to be very hit or miss.  I've gotten some excellent steaks, cooked quite well before, but have also gotten a number that felt like half gristle.  It felt like about a 30% chance of getting a bad steak.

Talking more of the erratic quality, an example, one time when I ordered the ciabatta turkey club, I got a sandwich with soggy ciabatta bread and RAW bacon (not just undercooked, it looked like it hadn't been cooked AT ALL!).  I've also gotten eggs burned at random times, bacon burned, hashbrowns burned, etc.  Again, this is not a 100% thing, but it is enough recently to make it not worth my while coming back anytime soon unfortunately.",2

He asked what beverages we would like and forgot one and had to get a ""refresh"" in order to fulfill, and then we waited for a waitress. 
We were told our waitress's name by our host and as always unless it's one of those un-names that just blows your socks off, like Kashikeewandamoo, it went in one ear and out the other. 
Unfortunate, because we NEVER got the opportunity to make her acquaintance. 
We waited and waited. And after a bit, decided the breakfast buffet would beat the alternative of nothing, so up we went.  Never realizing how wrong we were!
I have become over the years a less than enthusiastic buffet attendee. 
They tend to be harbingers of germs, old tired food, and some sadist is always trying to set up food far enough on the far side of the sneeze shield so as to require modified limbo dancing or monkey-arms that drag on the floor in order to get what one wants!  
So what did we have?
Absolutely the worst scrambled eggs ever!  So dry and crumbly they virtually refused to be manuvered by a fork as the sand-sized particles lacked the moisture to bind together.  It was like trying to eat flour!  
No waitress from whom to beg ketchup or hot sauce or beverage refills.
Eggs are delicate, don't cook a couple gallons at a throw so you never have to replenish,  cook small batches so the steam table doesn't dehydrate them over time,!  Also whenever possible  try to use real god^amn eggs and not the re-hydrated powdered used-to-be-eggs. 
The country potatoes or whatever they were supposed to be were equally dry, as well as burnt, and did I mention dry?  And man were they dry.  
I ended up putting sausage gravy on them hoping to find something to choke them down with and even that didn't work!  
The bacon was fine, but one does feel just a little silly filling a plate with bacon in order to flesh out one's plate!  
The owner is a very nice guy, (thin as a rail...I can see where eating here exclusively would be a weight-watcher's dream!) and when he walked by I told him we hadn't seen a waitress (we were finished dining at this point), and he said he would take care of us, refreshed our drinks and took them off the bill, so kudos to him for an attempt at a fix, but I would have been much happier had they just set off a bomb at the buffet station to blow it elsewhere, in deference to the well-being of the next hapless diner!

Their food, however, sucks.  It's supposed to be Asian fusion, and while I am still enjoying any ""fusion"" type place (aka, a hint of ethnic, a ton of Americanization), this is rather mediocre food at best, completely vegetarian unfriendly (which is odd, given the fact that this is Madison).

Service is good though, the staff is kind and attentive.

I ordered the spicy boneless wings. They were crispy, hot, meaty, with no skin and little fat. That was OK with me. 

The celling is tall and the south wall is all glass letting the winter sun in. This gave the place a wide open, airy, ""Texas ice house kind of feel"" (1PM) Which was OK with me because it was a beautiful day, but a little too chilly to sit outside on the patio in shorts. 

Nice tap beer selection especially for Chandler. I had a pint of Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale. Tasted OK to me. 

The bartender was friendly and attentive. I asked her about the tap selection and she had a working knowledge of craft beer. Eventually it came out that she was a beer fan and had a kegerator in her garage (things are getting interesting...). Service was OK with me. 

I like this place so far and will go back to try a different beer and menu item.

Start the burger FIRST, then start on the sandwich, then the dogs.
Fries are the LAST to go on the tray.

I want to say that maybe it's just a new kid getting the hang of it, but like any restaurant, it's still team work and they should be watching eachothers backs.

Ordered with Uber Eats and it came A LOT faster than the displayed time :) I guess because I live less than 5 min away? lol

About 28$ total for the food before any taxes or fees. I ordered 3 items.

No utensils or condements, or noticed they're uber menu asking me if i needed any. Good thing I was at home and not at work or something. I don't recommend this food for delivery as it would probably hold it's quality better if eaten right away in the restaurant, because apparently 5 minutes is too long for this food since they don't wrap it up in proper delivery packages.

One Grilled Cheese sandwich $4.25 : This was literally just a grilled cheese sandwich I could have gotten anywhere for 2$. Regular 2 slices of white toast and kraft single cheese in the middle, and ""pan-fried?"". Would had been nice to have pan fried it in beef juice since they do make burgers there. If they want to go the classic simple route to a grilled cheese while charging this much, then they should have changed the bread and cheese to bring more value to the price, also offer extra charges for side orders like pickles, salted tomatoes, or coleslaw and make it into a meal instead of just the sandwhich, of which I won't be ordering again if it stays the same. Because it was wrapped in wax paper, the heat excaped, cooling it down to the point where the cheese nearly solidifies and no longer stretches :(

One Smoke Meat sandwich $8.95 : This is actually pretty expensive for a smoked meat sandwich. The tiny bread was funny compared to the mountain of smoked meat, but I could live with that. What concerned me was the pale color of the meat. Tasted fine at least, nice moist and flavorful, but it came with nothing else for it's price?! Wierd, not even pickles or something... It was still more on the cold side eventhough they did wrap it up with metalic paper, so I don't know what is going on there.

Medium Sized Sausage Poutine $10.45 + extra cheese $4 : They apparently think HOT DOG WEINERS are sausages?! No way, that has to be a mislead because they have ""HOT DOGS"" written in the rest of their menu. They need to edit that because I was really disapointed, eventhough they gave me a mountain of these sliced weiners. As I was digging in, I have to say I laughed when I realized that I was having a hard time finding the fries lol I literally had more cheese than fries LOL I shouldn't have ordered the extra cheese because they honor it way more than any other food place I've ever seen, it was almost cute lol. It also wasn't hot enough, so the cheese curds didn't semi-melt. The gravy sauce tasted nice, though the quantity was lacking, and the fries were on the light side and soft, when LBP use to make them a lot darker. They put it in a styrofoam packaged which sucks compared to their older aluminum pie packages, so not only did it leak, but most of it's heat was lost in the 5 min travel time, which is really fast, and like I said, the way they package their food is not meant to be delivered, it's meant to be eaten there at their location, and I don't think they realise that.

Reading some of these reviews only now... I think the changes I noticed is all these peoples fault lol #1 You're supposed to wait a good 5 min before eating poutine ! That HEAT is the finishing touch of the cooking!

To the Restaurant Owner: I know how hard it can be to please everyone. Change one thing, and the ones who previously liked it will complain lol What I wish more restaurants/fast food places would do is offer more detailed choices on orders, that way you can't really go wrong. It's not enough to just have a ""note"" customers can write to the restaurant for each order, because I can imagine some changes will effect the price and I don't want a restaurant to feel their budget is breaking. I do like how close this place is, so I will try it again in a year to see if any changes were put in.",2

One day I walked in here and everyone was gone. I believe that this place is now under new management and has gone down the drain dramatically.  I usually don't rate this low unless it truely deserved it, based on service, atmosphere and food.

First impressions..this place is completely dead nowadays.  We walked in and the hostess was completely glued to the tv. We were literally standing there for a good 5 mins until my brother cleared his throat lol.  We sat down and already knew what we wanted since we pretty much know the breakfast menu in and out.  We ordered two orders of the two egg breakfast with sausage with a side of bacon. She then brought out two orders one with bacon and one with sausage. We then went and explained to her we both had sausage with sides of bacon.  She then brought out another side of bacon, which looked like it was quickly microwaved and totally tasted like chewy crap.  The order of sausage? Nowhere to be found....

We then asked for our check we got charged for 2x's sides of bacon and sausage. (the sausage was suppose to be included in the breakfast)  we didn't even bother to say anything and just paid the bill.

All in all... The service was horrid.  The food has gone down the drain..What a bad experience. Back then I would have given this place a 4/5 easy.

But that being said Substation II really reminded me of everything a meatball sub should NOT be...

My remembrance of a meatball sub:

Served on a toasted hot garlicky Italian sub roll topped with oooey gooey mozzarella, three large homemade meatballs, and sauce that would put your Italian grandmother to shame.

What I got - Salty McSalterson's sauce and 10 mini meatballs that easily came from the frozen foods section. If that was what I wanted I would head over to HT and pick some up myself. Sadly this sub had little cheese to offer but luckily the bread was at least fresh. Do yourself a favor and for 50 cents extra head to subway and get their foot-long because essentially they are on the same caliber ...actually if I am honest, subways rivaled theirs. 

They also have ""scrap"" sandwich on their menu ...I am not sure how this is suppose to sound appealing.

This will probably be my one and only visit here considering we have about 7 subshops within 2 minutes of my office. Yay Jersey Mikes !",2

My issue with this place is the cleanliness or lack of it. The place seemed dirty with many tables still holding used plates with old food. I don't understand why that needs to be that way since the place had 3 people in there when I walked in.  I had to search for a table as far away from one that had old food and plates on it. The washroom is disgustingly dirty and I can't understand why restaurants don't pay more attention to this area.

While fondue is always fun, I found this particular meal was lacking in the filling department. My husband and I ordered the cheese course for two (swiss and emmenthal cheeses with white wine and lemon), which was really delicious with apple slices and bread chunks. We followed up with steak and chicken (served with a selection of vegs and a hot, seasoned chicken broth). In retrospect, we should have given this course a miss and ordered more of the cheese! 

The cheese course cost us $13.00 for two (portion size was very small), while the ribeye cost $15.95 and the chicken $14.95 (all prices exclusive of taxes). We both definitely felt that we would have been better off eating at The Melting Pot because, while it is more expensive, it offers better value -- bigger portions, a larger selection of meats and seafood, more choices in regards to cooking methods (oils and different kinds of broths), and fixed price menus for groups with 2+ people. 

The atmosphere at Shabu was also lacking. A restaurant's quality can often be measured by how many covers it has in an evening. On the day after Christmas Day a restaurant should be buzzing. Shabu was nearly empty.

I will say that our server was quite excellent, though. She was attentive and a great conversationalist. If the food we had consumed had been to the same standard, I would definitely have rated this restaurant with 5 stars.",2

""Just wings.""

""Whatever comes in the meal."" I look at the little piece of paper ""It says 6 here...give me 6.""

""What size wedges?""

""Whatever comes with the meal...a small I guess?""

Got my food and meal should be $7 with wings a pop and wedges according to their menu and I get charges $9 and change (tax I'm sure) and get no pop. I'm done though so I just leave.

Get back to my work and open my food and the wings are cold and dry. I could have gotten better from the freezer section of the No Frills nearby, and the wedges are not seasoned in any way but taste like they were tossed in flour and also cold.

I work pretty close to this pub so my meeting with this pub was bound to happen. 

Let me start of with the good things about this pub: 
-Layout: Scruffy's has a great layout, it is cozy enough to be a stop for a first date and large enough to accommodate large parties of 20+ guests. 
-Servers: they are polite, will take your order and get it right more often than not (!!) which is surprising for a pub and even crack a joke once in a while 
-Prices: drinks are cheap, assuming you don't want anything too fancy ....grungy pub = cheap (local) drinks

That is unfortunately where the good things end. If you're going to Scruffy's for food, you will be disappointed. There's no question in my mind about this fact: their food sucks. To top it off, it's overpriced. There are countless other places with better food in the same intersection. 

Finally (this is the big reason they lose points), the service here is the WORST. You're probably thinking, ""David, you said the staff is great. What gives?"". Well dear reader, although the staff is wonderful, the process this pub has set up to transfer food orders into food is very bad. 

Story time:
Went with some work buddies (about 7 of us in total) for a quick lunch and drinks. Ordered our food and began our never-ending wait. We get our drinks a little late (~15 minutes after ordering). We finish our drinks, and we're told the food will be right there ""just order another round"". We order another round. Finish the 2nd round. No drinks. It's been ~45 minutes by this time. Finally, almost an hour after ordering our food/drinks, all of our food arrives (together thank goodness). Our quick lunch+drinks turns into an hour and a half of waiting/

All in all, Scruffy's is a great place to go for a quick drink, maybe some dirty food ....and that's it. 

TL:DR: cheap drinks (nothing fancy), awesome layout, garbage food and horrible process flow",2

This is yet another perfect example of a non-franchise establishment not being aware of their customer and thus dropping the proverbial ball.

They have a no children rule after 9, which alienates them from potential customers who would order food and possibly imports and keeps the 5 patrons instead who continue to drink their bottom barrel domestic.  I don't have a real big issue the kids after 9, but they turned away a party of 20 twice who were hungry and thirsty and instead catered to the 3 patrons at 9:00 PM on a weeknight.  Well done.  They carry the name Irish Pub, but it's obvious they've never been to Ireland.  They are after all a family environment big on community.  The food is sub par and easily attainable at any of the neighbouring establishments and quite frankly better tasting.  It's quite hard to screw up a pint so they do have that.

The baguette was dense and dry, the epi baguette seemed to be the best bread choice (though a tad dry), and the almond croissant, although deliciously almond-y, was quite heavy. Our second experience that day, however, left us frustrated. We ordered a house salad with grilled chicken to go. The menu described market greens and house vinaigrette-simple enough. 20 miles out of Madison we realized that we had slimy mustard greens, with mealy apples, extremely potent cheese (and believe me I can handle my cheese), and a few measly bites of chicken. $9 seemed outrageous for what looked like week old leftovers.

Last sunday, my mom and I were out on a power shopping spree at the pavillions when she said she wanted to go to Souper Salad, not wanting to i begruggingly agreed. We even dug through our back seat looking for their coupon in the sunday paper for a discount! We walked up and sat down and saw their DIRTY patio furniture... wtf?! Don't these people own a hose?! That was so dirty, I couldn't imagine trying to have a nice al fresco dining experience there! Luckily for me, it was the dirtiest part of the resturant.

We approached the door when a very loud man came and opened the door and exchanged pleasantries over and over again and was very happy to see us. Ummm... thanks? but can we atleast order our drinks first? He was a little happy. I unno - I was in a good mood, but I sorta just wanted to be left alone to eat. We got our salads and the greens were semi wilted and the cesar salad needed to be refilled but didn't :( and so I was left with some odd franken salad I threw together on my own. It wasn't that great - but that's my own doing. 

Their pasta salads and cole slaw and some of their fixin's looked very old and unappetizing! I couldn't even imagine eating them! I wished they had potato salad or carrot slaw (is that the word?) and macaroni salad... it wasn't good. But things did lighten up when I came across the soups.

I loooove soups!! They are my salvation after a hard day. I cozied up to a lil bowl of tomato based soup with mini shell pasta and veggies, it was delish! So was the Veggie Beef soup. I wish it didn't have so much onion,but I'm not a big fan of onions. and their tacos were GOOOOOD... not write home and tell everyone about it good... but very good. They remind me of the kind of tacos you make at home, out of a box but not all craptastic like how they come out when I do it. I honestly liked it. 

The cornbread was dry and my mom said her baked potato was too. The pizza looked too old to touch, so I unno about that one. 

The service was another thing... the same man, who I'm assuming is the owner always kept talking. Even when my mom said something along the lines of just wanting to enjoy our meals and we thanked him for his hospitatlity. But damn... SHUT UP! I felt like he wanted to sit down and talk shop with us... but we weren't there to meet with him... we were there to talk with one another. But he always refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly. So he got to keeep a star. 

To my fellow yelpers: if you're in the area and want fresh salads, this might not be the place for you... especially if you want to eat outside cafe style on nice clean patio furniture... but if you want a nice cozy bowl (or several like me) of soup and decent bread sticks then this place will hit the spot. You might need to shoo away the owner though in order to get some privacy and enjoy the people you arrive there with.",2

So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.  

Texas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.

Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :( 

Entrees.

Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:) 

Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned. 

Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.

Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible: 

Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that's for this occasion only , past two times it's been great fun for the kid,)

1.5 rounded to 1 for the carrots.",1

First off, as soon as we walked through the door we were hit with a bad odor (it smelled like a sewage/ventilation problem?).  Having been there several times before, I knew not to expect ambiance and that is one thing, but it could really stand a good cleaning (everything just looked like it would be sticky to touch, the table had something that looked like a dead bug stuck to it, walls were splattered with who knows what, and the menus were FILTHY -  I could go on....).  

We started with a cup of french onion soup with a side of french bread (both delicious).  For the main dish we split the chicken crepe and chicken salad sandwich.  The sandwich was very good.  The crepe was really very, very rich.  Did not like that the crepe was folded and not stuffed, and there was too much sauce for our taste.  I have had this before but probably would not order it again.  Ordered a plain crepe with sugar.  This took FOREVER to come out.  In the meantime the waitress was nowhere to be found - she did not offer a refill on my coffee, nor did she clear the dishes.  There were only a handful of tables occupies, and I counted at least 3 females and 1 or 2 male staff, so as far as I was concerned there was no excuse.  When the dessert finally came, dirty dishes still on table, I asked for a coffee refill but never did get it.  And there was no apology for the wait.  The dessert crepe itself was so-so - soggy on the bottom from moisture.  My family said that they much prefer the crepes I make at home.

Overall, a disappointment, as I would sooo love a decent crepe place nearby.",2

We tried to go see a movie late this afternoon but it winds up everything we wanted to see was sold out. So we perused Sport Mart for a while, got a couple deals and then he said: ""I'm really hungry."" So it was between White Chocolate Grill and McGrath's Fish House. Since we'd been to White Chocolate and McGrath's would give me another opporunity to write a review on yelp we decided on McGrath's. This was not the better of the two choices.

They seated us in a cavernous dining room that was empty save for two other groups of diners. In addition the room was very warm. I must depart from the review to let you know my partner is HOT, and not just in the way your dirty minds are thinking. So, shortly after being seated we're both very uncomfortable.

The good news is the service from our waiter Adam was great. The food, well it was just okay. We started with the Calamari Rings which were, you guessed it, just okay. I ordered Wood Fired Salmon and he ordered a King's Platter. The Salmon was far from wood-fired, grilled with some wood flavored seasoning sprinkled on it, I can do that at home. My partner's platter was also just okay. He said there's no reason to come back here. I have to say I must concur.

It is the no frills of no frills.

When I got there it was late in the evening and about an hour or two from the mall closing.  It was the busiest of all of the counters in that section and price range.  The P.Mall is cramped at the best of times and it felt that way with even half the capacity in the area.

Now the food looks good and there were so many selections that it was difficult to choose.  I saw they had shrimp in lobster sauce over rice.  It is a simple dish but I had not had it in ages so I ordered it.  

Not how my dad used to make it and it was a little on the salty side, which I can do without.  In spite of that, I am not ready to give up on this little cubby hole though.  I'll be back and hopefully they will give me reason to lift the review to something more respectable.

I'm hoping it was an 'off dish' for them and that it will not happen again.

When I first came to this restaurant, I asked them if they can substitute their meat in a fried noodle dish with tofu instead. I told them that I was willing to pay extra for this substitution and was willing to wait longer for them to prepare it. Keep in mind that this was late afternoon and there were maybe only 5 other people in total in the food court, most of whom were already eating their meals and the worker was just lounging around. 

He then told me that he could not substitute any meal with tofu instead of meat. First of all, tofu is cheaper than meat and I was willing to pay extra for it. Second of all, the restaurant that I went to next, RIGHT BESIDE this place, Casa Formosa, not only gladly substituted the meat for tofu for any of their dishes, but also let me choose what kind of tofu I wanted. 

I'm extremely disappointed since I know many Chinese vegetarians in the area who have converted due to their religion. I will point out that they do have 2 vegetarian dishes, however, having only 2 makes it get boring real quickly and it's not like adding tofu to the pan instead of meat is hard.

I don't think I could ask for a more perfect night, like God came down for 1 second and said ""Hey, I'll make all your dreams come true buddy.""

Enter Sugar Daddy's....

A few ex-coworkers invited me here, and since it was close I head over after the Sox game concluded. I am not  a big fan of Scottsdale bars in general, but went to see some friends. I even brought a sweatshirt for a friend per her request, who was ""chilly"" (see the above description of the weather)First let me say,  the patio is pretty cool, you can sit outside and enjoy the weather, being next to Scottsdale Rd, isn't so great, as wanna-be Hell's Angels cruise by on their bikes, buzzing the place like Tom Cruise in Top Gun. All that aside they had live music, basically A Dashboard Confessionals style, emo-acoustic  band. They were entertaining. The drink prices are reasonable, though a friend of mine (a girl) was billed for 21 miller Lites, which she claimed, ""was impossible to drink in 4 hours"" I said, ""well it is Miller Lite, which is basically seltzer water, with a splash of hops and barely, so you really could of had 21 beers"" She proceeded to drive herself home, you do the math. 
For the crowd, it would be what you'd expect, but a little better than what you see in old town Scottsdale, people were more down to Earth here, and pretty cool and laid back. I had no problem with the crowd, it was mellow. 
So as my friends decided to leave I ventured into the ""labyrinth  inside, and let me say this place is huge. The decor is like something out  of a Robert Rodriguez movie (insert from Dusk Till Dawn) and The set of The Munsters.  To me it had no real identity and conflicted completely with the patio style of Mexican Cantina. Inside there are many areas to get lost in, and dark corners were I could imagine horny Scottsdalians making out, and participating in heavy petting. After locating the bathroom, using my onboard GPS system, I decided to sit at the patio bar to finish my drink. I struck up a conversation with 2 of the female bartenders, as they were attractive, and emo/punk/tatoo'd/angst looking. (I can't help myself with girls like this sometimes) So one of The Donnas (reference to the rock-band of all girls that look the same) started to explain to me she spoke sign language, and could communicate this way. As we were talking she became more and more annoying, it is hard to believe that someone could sign, and be annoying, but it happened. I spoke to her, and found her to be rude, and somewhat obnoxious, it really just solidified my opinion of this place and left me with a bad taste in my mouth, like waking up in the morning after you had some cool-ranch Dorititos before bed. You try hard to remove the taste, brushing, mouth-wash, flossing, etc, but it just stays with you until you eat lunch.....Unfortunately  I haven't eaten lunch yet.",2

I chuckle now because several times, years ago, I would wait in a line to get into this place -- not on my own accord, mind you -- but because some of my buddies thought this place was the killer.  In fact, this place would be freaking AWESOME if it was plopped down on 3rd Street and Roosevelt.  But it had two major things working against it: 1) Their kickarse patio faces the lame part of Scottsdale Road, and 2) Their kickarse property is in the lame part of Scottsdale Road.

Granted, I still wouldn't go if this place was set in Old Town, but at least they wouldn't be gasping for air while the distant, populated beach of Goldwater shrugs a casual shoulder.

The meat isn't char grilled, but steamed on a flat-top and is greasy/wet enough that the little tortillas break apart before you get halfway through the first one.  I ended up dumping the mix into a pile, tossing the tortillas, and eating it like cereal.

In the past I've gone to Acappella and I've had decent Italian-American food for a fair price, and I've always made it to the show for curtain. Yesterday, however, I went to Acappella to see a 1PM show with my boyfriend and grandmother, and I had to leave in disgust without eating lunch. 

We arrived at 11:45, and the restaurant wasn't full. However, the wait staff appeared to be in their own world and they didn't even provide us with menus (we had to go up to the hostess stand and take them ourselves). At 12:30 I asked the waitress for the ETA on our 2 pasta dishes and bowl of soup, and she informed me that the cook hadn't even started preparing them. By 12:45 we still hadn't been served and left.

In total the three of us each had some coffee and a slice of bread before the show. At no point did the wait staff let us know that they weren't able to serve us in a timely fashion, and they didn't even bother to provide us with gift cards or anything else to salvage their reputation.

The only reason I'm giving Acappella 2 stars is because in the past they have done a good job, and I'm hoping that yesterday was a fluke for them. However, after yesterday's experience, I don't think I'll bother going to them again.",2

Honestly the worst Carrot Cake I've Ever had!

Served in a big thick square, no layers, no filling, it had the consistency of wet packed sand that was thinly covered with a flavorless white frost and sprinkled with toffee chips and topped with a soggy strawberry.UGH!

I'm so glad I didn't have lunch there, and now I never will.

It was also just a weird vibe walking in there, it's located in the same shabby courtyard as the country cottage, but had no class.

To the right as I walked in was a dimly lit area that looked like a ceremonial orgy room with a shrine to the God awful cake...WTF...

There was about 4 or 5 dark haired wannabe Italian guys running around acting like waiters.........is that supposed to be a turn on to get you ready for the non-climactic cake........I think only Pasta Brioni can pull that one off but barely.

So I took 2 bites and threw it in the trash, said thanks for nothing and called my husband to tell him he had NOTHING to worry about!!

We ordered spring rolls and pork gyozas/dumpling.  Both were very fried to a dark brown making them quite dry.  The dumpling filling was an odd flavor unlike any I've had before.  The spring roll was hideously sweet, from what I don't know.  Neither had a fresh vegetable taste, they were more like they had been mixed with the meat ages ago and became muddy.  

We ordered Pork Egg Foo Young  which was literally just egg, carrots, peas and sprouts.  Though the veggies were at least fresh the whole thing was devoid of any seasoning or flavor.  Also most places serve it with some kind of sauce, there was none.  Just a huge hunk of egg and veggies, that's it.  

We also ordered almond soo gai.  Again this was fried within a shade of being black.  The chicken inside was so dry it was not edible.  I would guess they were frozen for far too long and acquired freezer burn.  

Finally the coupon was for a free order of Chicken fried  rice.  It was literally rice and chicken with a few peas sprinkled on top.  Again no flavor, no seasoning and the chicken was dry as dry can be.  The rice was oddly plump and hard.  

Needless to say we will not try this place again.  Clearly they are cutting corners by over freezing food that doesn't get rotated frequently enough.  And I've never had such bland or oddly flavored food, especially chinese food.",1

I just started a job in Office Space near by on Elliot and needed a place I could get to, get served and get out within an hour with my friend on my dinner break. As we cruised Elliot, the lights blinking of Wal Marts, Costcos, JcPennys, and all the gruesome fast food chains like a garish consumerist Las Vegas, I decided on Chillis b/c at least their memory had not been horrendous. 

The last time I ate at one of these, it was TEN years ago-when I was 17. It was next to Borders Books in NJ, and I thought it was kind of sophisticated (hey, I had been brought up on Malls, okay?). 

The decor of this place confused me. The bar is right at the entrance with a supremely low ceiling. Seated at a tall table with some plush booths on the side and surrounded by five televisions, the waiter was fast with the iced teas. The bar was actually designed kind of cool, with beers in ice on the bar, kind of like the practice of picking out lobsters out of tanks. The drinks were disgusting looking (not our iced teas-they were fine-if served in PLASTIC beer mugs) in the menu, with all drinks mysteriously splashing and semen-resembling.

The decor...okay, there were also windows that looked out back into the restaurant...I mean I don't understand. Is it supposed to be bohemian? Like a ""mexican shack""? Country? The decor confuses me instead of comforts me. I feel like I am in a bad stage set of a western town, like a rompus room for tourist's kids or something.

We ended up with Southwestern Egg Rolls (which has like pureed chicken in it) and I did sneak a taste (yummy in the worst for you way-better than I remembered-but guarenteed to make my vegetarian stomach shrivel up and die) and the chocolate molten cake, which was OUT OF CONTROL. A fucking huge chocolate cake with hot fudge stuff inside a huge dent, with a large vanilla scoop of ice cream encased in a hard chocolate shell. 

These things were fine, standard, but expensive. Do people realize they are paying like 7 bucks for an appetizer and like 6 bucks for a dessert they could get a LOT more for their money at an independent ""real"" restaurant?

The stars go to the service-all nice, helpful, and not in a scary generic way.

I then asked her if I could now talk and let her know why I am here. She admitted I did not get my drink but argued with me about my other concerns, she says she watched her husband put the bacon on my sandwich even though I told her he did not. She wanted me to stay in the store and wait for her to replay they video of him putting bacon on my sandwich.  I told her I did not have time to do that due to me having to get back to work. But who in they right mind would argue with a paying customer. Before leaving she then told me, I don't need to be using uber and that uber is for ppl who don't have a car or can't get out the house.

The one thing I realized about this place was how overpriced everything was. Breakfast burrito - $9? Grilled chicken that was laying out in the deli  (no sauce or condiments) $8? There is another place like Dish that sells the exact same chicken for $5. I order the pizza at the restaurant and it was a really salty. I should have just went to Domino's.

I really had a hard time believing the prices they are charging for a grilled sandwich (almost $10) to pasta. Are you kidding me? Then I realized I'm in Scottsdale where people will eat anything in front of them as long as that place looks trendy (see Olive and Ivy). 

The concept is pretty good. You can pick up stuff for home if you don't have time to make anything. I think the prices are restaurant prices for a take out place. 

I think the location of Dish will attract considerable traffic. It's a huge place that offers pick up and a sit down restaurant. Most of the employees knew what they were talking about and were friendly. But, it's vastly overpriced for what they offer.

Update 9/12/07: People have said that the food is pricey, but it's Scottsdale...so it comes with the territory. That's what's wrong with most people. Location should not justify the prices, the food should. Actually, I don't mind spending money if the food is worth it (in fact, my favorite local seafood restaurant is Wildfish, not inexpensive). 

But, the food is alright compared to the prices. If you're a bit lazy and can't make a sandwich yourself at home, then by all means..spend $10+ for a sandwich here.  I think this is definitely catering to the right crowd.  This place is a larger, overpriced LGO with marginal food. I've tried the pizza, grilled chicken sandwich, burrito, and sushi. All were OK.  Perhaps, I am fortunate that my client/work pays whenever I go there. I think there are other places I would go to spend my OWN money.

I think Dish will do well because of it's location and because it is Scottsdale..where most people don't have a discerning taste bud.  

One positive thing I will say is that it's a quick, easy place to get a meal and the employees seem knowledgeable about what they sell. So, if you're not in the mood to cook or even sure what to eat, but want a myriad of overpriced choices then Dish is for you. 

Again, this is a personal opinion. I'm not trying to offend anyone.",2

To begin, you should be coming here with a truckstop diner mentality.

This is a truckstop diner in all its glory. Large portions, probably oversalted food, very efficient service (truckstop servers are my favourite for this reason), retro diner ambience (but not forced retro), and neverending coffee.

I got the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes, gravy, and steamed veg. Very salty, even for a sodiumphile like myself. Also tried the pierogies and sausage which were alright, as well as the hamburger steak.

Probably a great option for those lazy weekend mornings when you feel like going out for a huge, greasy, breakfast but don't want to line up with everyone else for the newest, cool, brunch place. +1 for credit card pay phones at some tables and the wall of stuffed husky toy animals at the front.",2

Nothing to WOW about.
Although their Specialty Pancakes look impressive as hell.
There is a Notice that these meals (even omelettes) may require an 18min cooking time over your basic bacon and eggs. Just an fyi.

Party of one. No counter to kick back at. Bummer.
Great service though. They are all over you, and very nice. Monica was a sweetheart.
Especially with what the servers are contending with......and you too if you come here.

Tuesday morning 10:00am. Waited only 5mins for my table.
Once seated I'm surrounded by a couple screaming kids, several folks (who remember phonebooths)  chatting away about taking their garbage cans out, or having been to Phoenix already, etc., LOUDLY.
All the while ingnoring those right in front of them? I'm finding it sad that older people have discovered public use of a cell phone too. They make loud speaking people louder.

Food is certainly worthy here. Except maybe the $3 small orange juice. Maybe even the $15 total which includes a $2 tip. And can most certainly get higher. I had a simple breakfast.

Will I come again? Probably not as a party of one. With my folks, or a ""morning after"" episode of a fine romance? Majority rules will have to win that one.

Give me the Mom & Pop breakfast joint any ol' time versus a place like this or similar.

Before owner was changed, it was my go-to-place.
After then, forget it.

I and my wife were impressed with their cutlet combo so we became quite regular here for long time.
With our hefty complement over and over, we came here with my sister's couple and parents without knowing the owner changed meanwhile.
Ordered cutlet combo, which comes with pork cutlet, fish katsu and hamburger steak.
Then, got pork cutlet only so asked to correct it.

Don't be too surprised with what happened.

Waiter, who seems to be the son of owner, came back to me and asked whether I ordered correctly.
Wow, what an excellent customer service... 
Really impressed!

It wasn't the end of story.
That waiter (yeah, it was him again!) took our dishes with angry inhale.
He left pork cutlet outside while chef was preparing for other two missing kinds. When the dish was served, pork cutlet was really cold...
As owner and chef changed, the overall quality was really bad, too.

Myself and a friend had dinner here, he ordered off the breakfast menu (ham and eggs) and I ordered the fish and chips. 

Service was slow to non-existent. meals were served without any cutlery and when I requested some, only I was supplied with any, my friend had to ask seperatly and wait even longer.

Food quality was terrible, the ham was poor quality and over cooked and while the fish wasn't as bad the batter wasn't quite restaurant quality.

That was the end of my dealings with Gabby but my friend went back the next morning to give it another chance. When he went to put cream in his coffee he found that the packet had expired and now half resembled cheese.

Long story short if you are looking for a nice meal go next door to Fry Basket, if its a bar you want, there are many others around that are better.",1

The owners are fortunate that they get unsuspecting and new customers each day because it is a hospital. If their business were based on returning customers, they would go bankrupt very quickly.

Basically good reviews. The lasagna was 5 layers of noodles, meaning noodle on top of noodle, under the 5 layers of noodles..yes, just noodles, was a thin layer of ricotta and another noodle. Nothing between the layers of just noodles, not even sauce. On top was some cheese baked golden brown, deceiving. The menu states meat sauce, 2 little flecks of meat is what I am looking at. I took 2 bites, and I stopped eating it. I went back to the kitchen to check the rest, thinking maybe I just got the end piece and the filling fell out. No. Next I try the gnocchi, chewy is an understatement. They were also hard. Not to confuse the al dente of the lasagna. This dish had one tiny piece of meat visible in the sauce. Smaller than a grain of rice. I didn't even try the chicken and rice soup yet, as I was so disappointed. I have never returned food, or even complained. I was hungry, and disappointed. I just called the place, and the women who answered told me I really should have called last night when I ordered. I picked up at 840p-845p. They close at 10. I should have called last night, because she can't do anything for me now. I don't want you to do anything for me, I wanted to express my opinion (something I never do) on how this food is not even edible. I was told I could call tomorrow when the boss (who I believe may be the cook) is in, but she can't do anything for me. Again, I stated I didn't want anything. I was told no one else ever complained about the lasagna. I said, according to what I found online (however most reviews are older) that is exactly why I ordered it, as I was thinking the same. The women up front were nice last night, today on the phone wasn't exactly the same. I am unsure if she just thought I was trying to get my items for free, or what the case was.

TV's on every wall,classic 50's 
boothes and all kinds of car memorabilia. Plus 
theres a bar & game room upstairs. There was no wait & plenty of seating when we arrived at 6:00 pm. After we were seated , 20 minutes later a teenage waitress came to take our drink order, 20 minutes later she came back with the drinks and took our order. We ordered 4 sliders,Fried Cheese, Pork Tenderloin & Country Fried Steak Sandwiches. A little pricier than the menu we had found on the 
interent but still fairly reasonable. While we waited for our appetizer we saw several disgruntled patrons complaining about the slow service & leaving. After an hour of waiting we still had NOT seen our waitress for a refill or explanation. There were at most 30-40 patrons in the place at this time. The people sitting across from us had to have waited 20 minutes for there bill and finally a 
waitress brought them every unpaid check and asked which one was theirs, the man left exact cash for the check & voiced quite loudly to no one in particular he wasn't leaving any damn tip-for what? On 2 
occasions while we were waiting with our EMPTY glasses on the edge of the table as a CLEAR sign we needed MORE to drink the waitresses would turn tail and run before they made eye contact and had to DO THEIR JOB!! Finally fed up with waiting for NO APPARENT REASON we decided to give up and go somewhere that actually serves their customers. We approached the waitress to find out what the problem was she laughed & said ""it's crazy in here"" with no apology or explanation for the ABSURDLY long wait. HELL we've waited an HOUR to get into a place with NO problem but an HOUR to see your waitress after you've ordered-NEVER and we eat out 3-4 times a week! To say it was BAD service is an understatement. We never had a chance to try any of the food but without a doubt there was NO way it would have been good enough to compensate for the 
atrocious service. The only way I would recommend this place is if it were FREE & they were POURING booze down your throat while you wait.

I had passed this place on the way home one night and vowed to see what it was about.  I checked out their website -- not too shabby!

Hubby and I decided to give it a go the other night.

What a disappointment.  I can't even articulate about how overcooked my food was or how meagre the service was.  I practically begged for water and silverware.

Words cannot describe how angry I felt when I left.  The food, the service, utterly disappointing.

I ordered their Cedar Plank Salmon.  The salmon was so overdone that the edges were past the point of crisp -- they were burnt.  I asked our server if I could please get one that was not quite so charred.  I swear she rolled her eyes at me.

The sides were the only highlight of that meal.  Hubby's meal was ""ok"" by his standards, but I could see a stream of resentment building in him.

It was a Thursday night, not too packed, but busy enough.  Our server was more concerned with her chatter with the other servers.  It's one thing to have friends at work, but you don't neglect the customer.  I saw that we were not the only ones who bore the brunt of her bad service.

When my plate came back, she slammed the dish down so hard that the salmon almost fell onto the table.

Surly much?

I have to say I was disappointed.

I have had a lot of Cuban sandwiches in my time, and have even gone so far as to roast my own pork, go to Compare's Foods for Cuban bread, and making my own (I'm a culinary student).  The sandwich at Carolina Grill has all the components -- the ham, the pork, the cheese, the mustard, pickle and Cuban bread -- but nothing was really very special.  My idea of a good Cuban has a meaty, chewiness to it -- thick slices of home-roasted pork, slices of good ham.

The ""roast pork"" here was, as the last reviewer said, some kind of pulled pork and not sliced.  In fact, it looked and tasted suspiciously like a commercial product of Carolina-style barbecue pork.  I noticed they have both ""Cuban Roast Pork"" and Barbecue Sandwiches on the menu, which makes me wonder maybe they started out using sliced roast pork and they switched to the barbecue.  The restaurant seemed a bit slow, and when places start cutting food costs because of that it is a vicious downhill cycle that leads to no good.  The ham also didn't impress -- the best Cubans I've had have ham that was cut from a chunk, like Honey Ham.  This place uses thin processed ham -- like the Danish baked ham that comes in rectangular plastic packages hanging next to the Oscar Meyers.  

I also had an appetizer of Ham Croquettes that were a frozen commercial product.  It wasn't bad, but I'd suggest the ""chef straight from Cuba,"" as one of the co-owners described, keep the box low so diners can't see it from the dining room.  Something like that tells me a lot about a place.  The chef has nothing to do in the afternoon slow period, but instead of making a batch of home-made croquettes from scratch to freeze (probably saving food cost too) he uses a commercial frozen product.

I think this place has the potential to be a good spot with home-made Cuban food, but they need to commit to making the food from scratch as much as possible instead of cutting corners with commercial products whenever they can.  And if they really want to push their Cuban Sandwich as the best (not a bad ideal at all), then they need to make it the best, starting with roasting the pork and using good ham.  More pickles woudn't hurt either.",2

I was excited to live close to a Carl's Jr. as I loved their food when I lived in California.
The first 2 or 3 times it was a little less than ok, and thought it just was an off day for them. Unfortunately, the food never got any better, and the service was lacking. Ordered a Famous Star, drink, and Zucchini once and came to the window. Gave them a $20 and they gave me a couple bucks back. I said how much was my order? They said with the 4 order of zucchini.... what? I wanted 1 order.They said to come back the next day for a refund, as there were no managers at the store until the next day WTH! 
The place burned down about 4 yrs ago, and they rebuilt it. The family and I thought we would try it again since it was new and fresh after the rebuilt. I punish myself about twice a year at this store hoping that something has change, but always come out disappointed. 
I eat at Carl's a couple times a month, but this one I avoid.
My wife called and wanted chicken tenders and zucchini on my way home. So I was close to home instead of the one by my work, so I tried this store again.
My wife said the food seemed quite cold after the long wait for the chicken tenders, and started to eat.
The reason was the chicken was raw!, I'm not talking under cooked, I'm talking RAW CHICKEN.
I called the phone number on the receipt over and over again as it would disconnect after 2 minutes and no answer. After calling for 20 minutes straight and no answer, I figured I would do my first yelp review since they do not want to here from me.
The one thing you can count on from this chain is being disappointed.

I came to this Carl's Jr after driving straight through from San Diego. I also drove 20 extra minutes from my hotel to come here.. I had double checked the hours (closed at 2 am), and debated if I even wanted to go out of my way for food. 
On Monday night, October 30th, at 1:30 am, I arrived at this Carl's Jr. As I was driving up, I noticed a car reversing out of the drive though... uh-oh. 
I am a human being. I can completely understand that on a Monday night it would be dead. Not having any customers for hours, and the employees decide to close early and go home. I get it, not cool, but I get it. 
I was pretty upset that night though, as you could probably understand. I was going to leave a note so the openers knew that they had lost money by closing early. (Not that that was the best decision, but this is the story.) I was going to wedge it in the drive through window; as I touched it, it slid open about a half inch, even though it was still locked.
This noise, then prompted the employees, hiding in the back, to come see what it was. THE EMPLOYEES WERE THERE THE WHOLE TIME. The lights were off, they hadn't answered the phone when I called prior to coming, and they said nothing at the drive through intercom. They were shocked to see me standing outside my car. I held up my note for them, which called them lazy, and said something to the effect of ""I just want some food"". They proceeded to laugh at me. Well, I got one of them in a photo. 

To consumers reading this, I don't know what to tell you. Just don't hit this location after midnight I guess. I imagine this wasn't the first time, and won't be the last if they stay employeed here..

It's one thing to close early and go home, but to close early and just sit around at work in the dark?? Pathetic. And laugh at someone who is clearly hangry?! ... smh

To those girls, go apply at a place that closes at 8pm.. 

For the manager to help identify them:
The employees were presumably two females. The one who was able to dodge the photo was young, dark hair, with shorter hair in a pony tail, and shorter than 5'6"", and wearing make up. The one in the photo seemed to have a natural look, and also had dark hair. She seemed taller than the other girl. 

So to the manager here, your employees are taking advantage of you.",1

The won ton soup had a plain broth - not very tasteful but the won tons themselves were good.

The spring rolls were excellent and were highlights of the meal.

The orange beef lacked any crispness even before being reheated and was in a dark brown sweet sauce that lacked any orange flavor.

The chicken fried rice was very dry and needed sauce from one or more of the other dishes to be edible.

the big shrimp and vegetables was very good. Decent sized shrimp and stir fried vegetables that were fresh and were flavorful.

The chicken in spicy peanut butter sauce was the mystery dish or the night. I think it was another dish altogether. The thinly sliced chicken was tender but the sauce was orange colored and greasy and there was nothing resembling peanut butter or spice (see photo).

I merely wandered in and right back out. 

Gone is the crowd and the long wait on a weekend morning waiting for a Pischke's greasy and tasty breakfast. Gone is the kitschy decor that gave the place character. Gone are the sassy waitresses who looked like they needed a good night sleep. Gone are the bursting menus full of good eats at reasonable prices.

Replacing all of this is a bland and boring decor, 50% fewer menu choices, and 50% higher prices. The place was pretty empty while every other breakfast place in the neighborhood (we drove past 5 others) was packed with a line going out the door. Here's a tip for Mr Robert McGrath - if you buy a successful restaurant, don't make drastic changes and jack up the prices... in other words - if it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

I'm actually kinda pissed too because I thought Pischke's was pretty good and it was definitely adding character to our city... what's there now is just another boring restaurant. There's plenty of those around here... Pischke's was unique to the area. When I visit my sister in Minnesota, she has some really neat breakfast places she takes me to that are decorated as an eclectic mess, but that blow you away with good greasy food and are dripping with atmosphere and fun. Same story when I go to San Diego or Long Beach to visit friends. Neat hip cities have neat hip breakfast joints. Well now we have one fewer. 

It's true - I haven't eaten here and perhaps Robert McGrath makes the most bomb-ass bacon and eggs this side of the equator... but it would seriously have to blow my mind to put this place back on my list of places to go. The empty seats told me the story anyway. Before I left, I told the hostess to put it back the way it was.

Here's my original review of the original restaurant - sad to see it gone:

Fantastic breakfasts - a little on the greasy side, but it's a neat little greasy spoon in old town Scottsdale. It belongs in Seattle or Minnesota really. It's certainly a favorable alternative to a breakfast at The Breakfast Club. The staff isn't quite as pretty (but so what?) and the food is a little bit more greasy (but it's oh so good). You don't have to get dressed up to go to breakfast like you do in some of the downtown scottsdale places which is nice. 

It beats going to Denny's and it's reliable for some good food... you can't go wrong here and the crowd is diverse and make for great people-watching. Sometimes it gets really busy, but the wait usually isn't too bad.",1

Unfortunately, since Aaron's last visit, changes have been made.

Now Pischke's is a bland eatery with a rather uninspired, limited menu positioned at the aspirational eating price point. As far as I can tell Pischke's target customer is well off older people who are looking for unchallenging options and prices high enough to keep out the riff raff.

Pischke's no longer serves daily brunch, so we had lunch on our visit. Among our group of six, not one of the dishes stood out in a positive way. The burger and salads were average. The crepes were decent but small and nothing special. The pork verde was fine, but inexplicably served with buttered flour tortillas. The pot pie was atrocious-- a ""deconstructed"" take on the typical comfort food it consisted of a large bowl filled with extremely bland pot pie filling, topped by a thin layer of philo dough flakes. It was devoid of everything (taste, crust) that makes a pot pie good.

The food was complimented by very poor service. Our waiter was totally smarmy and condescending, my drink order went unfilled, and when the food was served the waiter had coded the seats wrong so every single meal was placed in front of the wrong person.

Highly unimpressive. While Phoenix may not be known as a fine dining destination, there are plenty of great restaurants in the area to patronize instead. Don't waste your calories, time or money at Pischke's.",1

And now on to the entree which consisted of overcooked salmon, burnt spices on the top, and RAW skin underneath, did not make any since to me. it came with a brick of polenta edible only by the pool of sauce on the plate.

While we were waiting as patiently as we could the waiter takes the full order (drinks, apps, meal) of the couple who were seated 15 minutes after we arrived! Of course I would be understanding on the wait if the place was packed but there were only 5 tables filled in the entire place!!

We finally ordered and the watier came back 3 different times to clarify what we ordered.

The complimentary bread finally arrived along with our drinks, which by the way were terrible and in filthy (spotty, lipstick stained, crusty).  The bread was really great though so I started to have hope.

From the App's the Scallop and Goat cheese was great- the duck and mushroom was bland.

Main meal of pork chops and sea bass were boring. 

Oh when we got the bill they only did Well Martini's- would that have explained the poor taste or do they just not know how to make?

Service Slow
Waiter Confused
Martini Horrible
Dirty Dirty Glasses

The service was extremely friendly and very attentive - so much so that I couldn't bring myself to complain about the food.  I simply asked for a carryout container, boxed it up, and threw it out at my hotel.  

It was really cheap though - $15.00 for entree and egg roll.  I was on my expense account, so it didn't bother me to go somewhere else to eat that night.

On a 9 a.m. visit, the first thing I noticed was that this shop offers soups, sandwiches, and salads.  I wasn't in the mood for typical breakfast items. I asked the attendant whether they were serving sandwiches.  I even pointed to sandwiches on the menu.  No, he replied, only breakfast items (bacon, sausage, or ham and egg croissants or bagels).

You can't nuke a croissant.  My $4 croissant was no better than a cheap Jimmy Dean frozen sausage croissant from the grocery store. It came with coffee that was nothing special. I pumped the coffee from dispensers that ran dry.  You get better coffee from 7-Eleven.

I noticed servers standing around the soup and salad area.  Out of curiosity, I asked if they were serving soup and sandwiches.  Yes, they serve soup, salad, and sandwiches all day.

I asked the attendant who helped me at first.  ""I thought you said you weren't serving sandwiches.""
   ""Oh no.  We serve them all day!""

What can you do?  I spoke English and apparently he understood it.  What went wrong is anyone's guess.  My first experience here was highly negative.  It's a nice shop, however.  The attendant was friendly and pleasant. Maybe the misunderstanding was somehow all my fault.

Rather than buy anything here, pick up a cheap breakfast sandwich at the nearby Terrible's convenience store. 

Or, take your chances on their soups, sandwiches, and salads. There are pretty pictures all around the shop that make the offerings look tasty.",1

I must also disclose that this will be one the few times that I will write a review based on ONE visit - I normally like to visit at least twice but I would like to live to see another day, and I'm afraid that may not happen if I go there again.

Background: me and few friends had been eyeing this spot for a while; but it gave an eerie feeling and we never ventured. Believing in the power in numbers and in the spirit of adventure, 3 of us went - apparently that was not enough.

The decor? non-existent.
menu? well, most were not available but regular pub food. We got burgers and onion rings and pitcher of beer. I will say that was the crispiest rings ever!made me miss Harvey's onion rings very much. Hamburgers were bland and had a home-made quality, definitely filling. The BLT sandwich was just that: bacon, lettuce, tomato between toasts - nothing else....for $4.

Based on the above, I would have returned except, things got weird. 
The crowd there - sketchy at best (but in that weirdly frightening way- not in the Parkdalian kinda way ), is what would prevent the second visit.

People were watching us, music turned out loudly and someone on his way out to pee(I'm told), stopped behind my friend and gave me a look. A few minutes later, my friends who are born and raised in the small town ways, strongly advised that i finish the beer - and I did as I was told.
As we left, someone half way followed us and another man started screaming - and the staff were nonchalant and indifferent about a mini-fight or the strange group of people just hovering the counter; they weren't going to help us if anything happened.

So.
If you are feeling brave and adventurous, this is where you go. Otherwise, Ronsey is filled with other joyful spots than this, where you don't feel life threatened.",1

My wafer fries were cold and disgusting and my cheese sticks were cold as well (yum). Go figure lol. Well before we got off the phone George told me my next order would be discounted.

So I order buffalo wings hoping the food might just arrive before my hubby has to leave. 45 minutes pass and guess who calls back? yep you guessed it they have no wings either. The ""manager"" I speak to says that she is tired of me ordering complicated items and that if I 2 on accept something ""easier"" that I can just eat somewhere else. Wow I almost list it but I am a mother trying to set the right example so I ask if the owner could kindly call me back. (oh yeah I end up canceling my order ) when he finally calls me he said that 8 his own words "" he cannot find good help in the ghetto"" and that he will not do anything because he simply does not care. I believe him about not caring because it was quite evident in his tone and verbal demeanor.  He also argued with me saying he never offered me any discount .

The presentation of pastries here was underwhelming, nothing ""looked"" good, and the decor was subpar (I'm not a big decor guy, but it does leave an impression).  

Der Brokorb is a small tucked away bakery and sandwich place in Woodchester mall.  A selection of freshly baked breads ($3 per loaf) lines the wall behind the counter which has a small selection of pastries, homemade cookies and desserts.

I stopped by for breakfast, but not a whole lot looked especially appetizing. The only thing that quirked my interest was this chocolate almond cookie thing  ($1.50, see the picture), but it wasn't very tasty. There wasn't another person in the place, so I'm questioning whether turnover is a problem and how fresh the pastries are.


Individual apple pies ($3 each), homemade cookies ($3 per box) looked fairly average.

On the positive side of things, when I walked in through the door I was hit with the smell of freshly baking bread so maybe their breads are pretty good. I wouldn't mind trying a sandwich, but the pastries and cookies didn't leave a good impression.  

Not much of a place for decor, had a few tables for sit down as they serve sandwiches and soups during lunch.",2

However it came up because I searched for Olive Mill. 
When we first got to the place the 'tour' was highly recommended by the person receiving us at the door. 
My poor rating is due to the totally over priced COMMERCIAL which is called a 'tour' and basically has you seated in a small outdoor tent like structure to give you a 5 minute history lesson about the owners who bought the 'farm' in 1998 and a small lesson on how the olives are harvested. Either with a vibrating rake manually or a machine, depending on how closely the trees are planted. The majority of the time is taken up with giving a video demo of the same info the young tour guide rattled off and then giving a commercial about the spa the wife runs and the many uses for olive oil. 
I can give you the tour right here, right now for free. 
Olive oil goes well with chicken and fish and salads. Now repeat this 4 or 5 times and you've got the tour. Also if your olive oils go rancid, feel free to use them for skin care. Funny- I use mine for skincare before it goes rancid. 
The tour DOES NOT INCLUDE a tour of the olive grove. 

    I told 'Emily' who called herself an assistant manager that the place was really nice but the tour was an overpriced commercial and left us feeling disappointed. My daughter who took us out payed $28 for the tour and was left not being able to afford the wine she would have loved to buy. We all agreed that the Tour should have been free to allow us to listen and turn around to walk away when we realized it was just a commercial, which I mute at home when I watch TV. 
The food was yummy, over priced and more of an appetizer portions than a dinner meal. 
In the end the tour was the disappointment that stuck with us and I will Not recommend this place to my relatives who come out to visit in the future. Please if you go out to the Queen Creek Olive Mill, do yourself a favor and skip the tour. It's a waste of your time. Buy a bottle of wine instead. 

In my daughter Sages words- the tour is a scam.",1

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
The Braddock Hills restaurant Rudy's Submarines has been ordered closed following a series of violations, the Allegheny County Health Department announced this morning.

On Thursday, the restaurant's health permit was suspended because it lacked a certified food protection manager, had neither a handwashing sink in the food preparation area nor hot water and soap, and had no date-marking equipment. Counters were not properly cleaned and sanitized, and the floor and ceiling were in poor condition, according to the Health Department.

On Friday, the Yost Boulevard eatery was found to be operating in spite of the closure order. So a second order has been issued, and a red closure placard placed on the front door.",1

I asked a very close relative, whom lived in the Iredell Cabarrus area, she said Lake Todd food is good, off Hwy 3, but She stated she didn't feel comfortable dining in there, she didn't explain why, so myself and husband drove from Charlotte to check it out. I wanted to dine  in, so my food would be fresh and hot, 
When we arrived we wasn't greeted properly, maybe they didn't know any better, but that was our first time at their restaurant.I am A very  bold liberal person, in which,  I feel every race creed and color should be treated equally. I didn't feel that in the atmosphere at all, when myself and husband sat down, of course we had to find our own seats, in which is ok, but it seem like everyone in there, even the youths act if they had seen someone from out of space. Very unfriendly atmosphere, to the point we had to get up and leave, without ordering. I am from this area grew up and was raise in this area and lived in this area until I got Married, I have a lot to say, but this isn't the platform to voice it on, but if you don't want to welcome or eat with any other race other than the white race, you should have a sign that says for whites only. I grew up when it was signs like that in Iredell, Cabarrus, Catawba, Rowan, Lincolnton, and Union counties, there are plenty others, but these are the counties where I visit or lived at.  As A young lady I fought hard behind the scenes to make it a better place to lived and work in that area for all race,  til the point my father stated I had  to leave town , because they had Labeled as a Black Militant, and it wasn't safe for me to live there , being a  young country girl , I asked him what did that meant,  and he explained it to me. I couldn't tell no one what he shared with me , so at 17 years of age I moved to Charlotte to live with an Aunt until he told me it was ok to come back. When I went to that Fish Camp it took me back to the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s . I can't apologize for this review ,  I am not telling anyone not to go there, but this is what happen to myself and my husband...and if it has happen to anyone else, speak up,,,,,Think about it!!!
No I will not recommend or go back there to eat, And I have white and black African Americans friends...",1

Maybe leftovers from previous diner? 

The way too salty taste of the fries spread to the steak as well. It was barely edible, which was a shame because it was a perfect medium rare.

We also order the 1 lb chicken wings because according to other reviews say it was fall off the bone goodness. We got it grilled because it was healthier. This too was also disappointing. These were the most tasteless wings I have ever put in my mouth. My girlfriend had to take it home and put some soya sauce on it. Yes very Asian.

The overall ambiance was nice with the reclaim wood wall and the glass doors. The waitress was new and was friendly. She was confused when I replied that the steak and fries were too salty. But if I just wanted nice ambiance and good service I would have went to the museum!

As loyal customers we are highly disappointed in the change. They have added an Indian Buffet to the restaurant. The macaroni and cheese was not cheesy but tasted like flour and was soupy. The cole slaw had an after taste to it like it had not been properly covered in the refrigerator at night and absorbed the odor of other foods. After leaving the restaurant the smell of the Indian curry lingered in our nostrils and attached to our clothing. Unfortunately, we will now have to find a new Broaster Chicken restaurant. We will not be going back.",1

Not sure why they have omelette in the name?   The omelette I had was overcooked and rubbery.   It was as though they pre-made them and tried to microwave them before serving (you know, when it's SO HOT in the middle of the omelette? You can't help but suspect microwaving).   

No.  Stop now.  Turn around, go hit McDonalds if you have to - just don't go here!

While eating the omelet, i noticed that there were several raw pieces on my plate. I brought this to the servers attention who immediately took my plate to go show her boss. When she came back she said it was pieces of ""tendon"". It was very obvious that it was raw meat. Not only did the manager not come to our table to explain and apologize, but she refused to take it off the bill. I will be filing a formal complaint with the health department and will not be going back to Ollies ever again.  Do Not Eat Here!",1

Other than that...service sucks! You will be waiting for a looooong time before they take your drink order....then another loooong time before they take your food order. If you order coffe...it will also be a loooong wait for a refill. Don't know if they are short staff or what it they need to fix it.,2
