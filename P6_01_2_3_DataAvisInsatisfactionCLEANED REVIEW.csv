"I decided to try Marvellous Edibles because of the rave review the first reviewer gave it, and because it is in my neighborhood of Leaside. I've always driven past it and wondered what it was like, but since she gave it such a great review, I thought I'd give it a go. 

The restaurant has a sort of Parisian cafe feel to it, with mismatched chairs and some booths and tables, and a mural on the wall. Upon arrival mid-Saturday afternoon, we were also presented with 3 menus, breakfast (which was ending shortly), sandwiches and another menu which appeared to be dinner options, priced $16 - $24 range. My friend and I both selected from the sandwich menu. 

I ordered the BLT, but having noticed that they served peameal bacon for breakfast, asked if I could have peameal on my BLT, they obliged, no problem. My friend ordered the meat loaf sandwich and we both ordered the sweet potato fries. 

Service was fast, there were only 2 other occupied tables in the restaurant. I was expecting an average sandwich, didn't really figure you can screw up a BLT, er...thought wrong. The peameal was overcooked, and very dry, and it was served on 'white' bread, no egg or challah bread to be found here!! I was disappointed. The whole sandwich was dry, I asked for mayo, and the waiter said there was already mayo on it, I opened it up and the thing was bare. I showed him, and said, ""Umm, actually there's not..."" (awkward...) 

My friend's meatloaf sandwich was a mess!! First she had asked for no onions, was allergic to them, and upon receiving the sandwich, had to proceed to pick off somewhere in the range of 7-8 pieces of red onion off of her sandwich!! The problem with the sandwich was just that it was a complete mess. It was on a regular bun, and gravy was poured over the meatloaf and the other half of the bun was placed on top. On service, the bottom part of the bun, is soaked, drenched in gravy, making it impossible to pick up! It was just a mess, I think it would be a much more successful item choice if perhaps it was served as an open faced meat loaf sandwich, with the gravy in a boat on the side that you pour on yourself at the time you are going to eat it, so that the bottom bun doesn't disintegrate. 

As if our food quality wasn't bad enough while we were attempting to salvage a meal out of it, our entertainment was listening to our waiter bicker with the other waitress about table assignment and allocation of tips and how unfair she had been. The disagreement got quite heated and their voices were raised, creating quite a bit of tension in the restaurant amongst the customers, or at least, that was my perception. 

Overall, I was not impressed with the food or the service of this restaurant. I would not recommend it. I will not be returning to try their breakfast or brunch, or even to give it a second chance. Unfortunately, that was my very first and last visit. You know what they say, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.",1,decid tri marvel edibl becaus rave review first review gave becaus neighborhood leasid alway driven past wonder wa like sinc gave great review thought give go restaur ha sort parisian cafe feel mismatch chair booth tabl mural wall upon arriv afternoon also present menu breakfast wa end shortli sandwich anoth menu appear dinner option price rang friend select sandwich menu order blt notic serv peameal bacon breakfast ask could peameal blt oblig problem friend order meat loaf sandwich order sweet potato fri servic wa fast onli occupi tabl restaur wa expect averag sandwich realli figur screw blt er thought wrong peameal wa overcook veri dri wa serv bread egg challah bread found wa disappoint whole sandwich wa dri ask mayo waiter said wa alreadi mayo open thing wa bare show said umm actual awkward friend meatloaf sandwich wa mess first ask onion wa allerg upon receiv sandwich proceed pick somewher rang piec red onion sandwich problem sandwich wa wa complet mess wa regular bun gravi wa meatloaf half bun wa place top servic bottom part bun soak drench gravi make imposs pick wa mess think would much success item choic perhap wa serv open face meat loaf sandwich gravi boat side time go eat bottom bun doe disintegr food qualiti wa bad enough attempt salvag meal entertain wa listen waiter bicker waitress tabl assign alloc tip unfair disagr got quit heat voic rais creat quit bit tension restaur amongst custom least wa percept overal wa impress food servic thi restaur would recommend return tri breakfast brunch even give second chanc unfortun wa veri first last visit know say never get second chanc make first impress
Came back into town after I moved out of state for a few years. We ordered the normal chicken salad with house dressing and chicken wings seasoned and to be honest. It was nothing like it used to be. The fries were dried out. Dressing was all paste. And the chicken wings didn't seem completely done. It's a shame bc I used to love this place. It def turned my taste buds to go elsewhere though. Hopefully it changes next time I visit!,2,came back town move state year order normal chicken salad hous dress chicken wing season honest wa noth like use fri dri dress wa past chicken wing seem complet done shame bc use love thi place def turn tast bud go elsewher though hope chang next time visit

"Consider this place a mid flight refueling station between the downtown nightclubs and a night in jail somewhere in the Heights lol

Definitely not a place for the faint hearted. I usually frequent the place late hours(2:00am-4:00am crazy huh?). The food is typical greasy spoon but good. The gyros are really good too. They buzz you to the restrooms through a locked door at the top of the stairs(apparently to control the vagrant piss population). They are conveniently located in an abyss of a catacomb basement piss trough(it may be better to wet your pants and stay alive than to chance it...)

"When we arrived it took our waitress considerable time to bring us 2 diet cokes let alone even take our order. She kept walking by us and saying that she would be right with us, however it took her 20 minutes of backing and forthing to actually get to us and the restaurant wasn't even that busy later on a sunday evening. We decided to order calamari with tomato sauce. It was brought out in 35 minutes without tomato sauce. After asking for the tomato sauce, it took another 10 minutes to get it. But I have to say the calamari was probably the only decent thing about this night. We got our food shortly after. I ordered the goat cheese ravioli with smoked salmon. I'm 99% sure that there was little to no goat cheese in my ravioli as it had the taste and texture of ricotta cheese...something you'd pick up frozen at the grocery store. I also had to search for any pieces of smoked salmon as they were miniscule and few and far between. Overall, I've had store bought pasta much better than that. My boyfriend ordered the New York striploin which was supposed to come with tempura onion rings...there were none to be seen. The cut of the steak was completely wrong and the whole middle of the steak was all gristle. He also asked for sauce on the side and his steak was completely coated in it. It was disgusting and I actually felt bad watching him eat it and try to cut the thing. We then sat for 20 minutes waiting for the waitress to clear our plates and give us our bill. She would walk by us continuously and ignore us. We had a coupon for the restaurant which is another reason why we decided to try it, and both waitresses tried to short change us on the value of it, finally after telling them 3 times what needed to be done, they got it right.The service here was atrocious, the food was seriously lacking, especially for the price, the atmosphere was alright however it was freezing because it was cold and drafty.I'd never waste my time going here again and would warn other people about going there.

"This was easily the worst dining experience I have ever had.
I reserved for four people on the Saturday before Mother's day at 7pm. When we arrived we were placed in the bar, with music so loud it made conversation virtually impossible. I asked the hostess about seating in the restaurant as I had reserved and she said it was full. She offered to move us to another table in the bar, ut it was closer to the live music and would have been even noisier.
We ordered some drinks and I was confronted with a bottle of beer, with no glass. There was nothing fine dining about the atmosphere or he service. It was a bar room experience at fine dining prices.
The food was the only thing left to rescue the evening and it was a disaster. I ordered the pork tenderloin which was so overcooked that I thought they has served a pork chop with the bone in. It was also flavorless and burnt. My dining companions also expressed great disappointment with their meals, using terms like flavorless, over-cooked and cold.
We quickly paid the bill and left to seek a more appropriate venue for dessert and coffee. By this time even Tim Horton's seemed appealing.
Avoid this restaurant. The only thing that is fine dining is the pricing.",1,thi wa easili worst dine experi ever reserv four peopl saturday befor mother day arriv place bar music loud made convers virtual imposs ask hostess seat restaur reserv said wa full offer move u anoth tabl bar ut wa closer live music would even noisier order drink wa confront bottl beer glass wa noth fine dine atmospher servic wa bar room experi fine dine price food wa onli thing left rescu even wa disast order pork tenderloin wa overcook thought ha serv pork chop bone wa also flavorless burnt dine companion also express great disappoint meal use term like flavorless cold quickli paid bill left seek appropri venu dessert coffe thi time even tim horton seem appeal avoid thi restaur onli thing fine dine price
"I was definitely seeing a lot of red at the Red Martini!  I usually have a 3 strikes and you're out policy... If this were a baseball game, the Red Martini's winning streak would be in the negatives!

It was my high school English teacher's birthday and because she lives I'm the Durham Region we usually dine somewhere in Pickering or Ajax. It gets me out of Toronto once in awhile.  So I had made reservations for 7pm. When we arrived there were 2 occupied tables in the downstairs bar lounge.  We stood there for 5 minutes with no sign of any hostess or staff.  After what seemed like an eternal wait, the waitress appeared and she told us we could choose a table either upstairs or downstairs.  We opted for the upper level.

The Red Martini is a house-converted restaurant, similar to 22 Church Street Bistro across the street.  A co-worker told me that the 2 restaurant are owned by the same owner, however this is unconfirmed.  However I did spot a lot of similarities.

Once we chose our table, again we were left unattended and ignored for awhile. We quickly realized that the waitress who ""greeted"" us downstairs was the only staff in the front end for the entire restaurant. Strike 1 - understaffed.

My high school English teacher loves her white wine and she usually orders the house white.  Strike 2 - they were out of their house white.  This is a clear indication of poor restaurant management.  So we had no other choice than to order the next available white wine which was twice the cost.

We waited for our appetizer - no bread basket appeared - Strike 3 and you're out! 

We ordered and shared the Stuffed Portobello Mushroom Salad to start. This could've easily been THE best tasting salad I've ever had in my life. However, the minor neglect in detail made it second best.  The salad was a deconstructed-style salad. The grilled portobello mushrooms were delicious. The ""stuffing"" was made from imitation crab meat and eggs... So essentially it tasted like an egg salad.  It was also served with COLD naan bread... It would've been the perfect salad if they grilled the naan. We had requested that the appetizer come first and then our mains... However the server showed up 2 minutes into us digging into our salads, so we had to send her back to the kitchen and requested the food be kept warm.

My Coconut Tilapia was served with a spicy plum sauce, Bok Choy, red and yellow bell peppers and jasmine rice. When I first bit into the tilapia I was excited that the fish skin was so crisp... But I quickly realized that the crisp was not due to skillful culinary execution, but rather to a burnt fish... Parts of it were so burnt I started tasting charcoal!  Also, the ""coconut"" component of the dish was M.I.A.  This dish had so much potential.. *sigh*

I didn't try my teacher's Veggie Stir-Fry with Chicken but the feedback I got from her wad that the vegetables were cooked to a mush, and that the chicken was dry.  In their defense, the mush factor may have been a result of the dish being kept on a warming plate.

To finish we ordered a cappuccino, tea and marbled cheesecake.  The server came back up to inform me that they don't offer cappuccino... How do you not know that?  Its like she was a temp hired to tide over a quiet Sunday restaurant service.  So I settled for a coffee.  

The cheesecake was average, nothing spectacular.  

At the end of the day, the bill came to $105.  I will say that the portion sizes are generous and the food does have potential... However, the service aspect is going to need a complete facelift.  I had such high hopes for you Red Martini... I thought you'd be sizzling...

Si Senor is not my favorite taco option. I got a steak taco and the bit of steak was so little my meat was about the size of a quarter. I could hardly believe how little meat I had.   I ate here because in the summer they have an outside food stand at the USX tower.  I remember being out of the taco that wanted.  So whenever a food venture is out of something that I want that immediately knocks off some starts for me.  The salsa options were great but I dare say Qdoba is better then this place.,2,si senor favorit taco option got steak taco bit steak wa littl meat wa size quarter could hardli believ littl meat ate becaus summer outsid food stand usx tower rememb taco want whenev food ventur someth want immedi knock start salsa option great dare say qdoba better thi place

"Ick.  I don't think this classifies as Mexican.  I was mislead by the name but should have known better once I saw they offer wraps.  I figured they used the name wraps in place of burritos since... well... Pittsburgh is really unfamiliar with Mexican food.

I ordered the classic wrap which, according to the description, is your choice of protein, beans, cheese, rice, and choice of sauce stuffed in a tortilla.  I went with the shredded beef and chipotle sauce.  What I got ... well I can see why they referred to it as a wrap and not a burrito.  The tortilla was cold (what?) and the ""shredded beef"" was more like beef chunks.  The iceberg lettuce was an unwelcome surprise.  Black beans.... I hate black beans.  I guess it was wrong to assume they would be pinto or refried.  The chipotle sauce wasn't spicy at all and just added a burnt flavor.

Would never come back.  I can't believe I paid $7.20 for this wrap.  

If for some odd reason you want to try this place.... they do offer vegan / vegetarian options with grilled veggies and tofu as an option for your filling.

"I tried the Gilbert location of this restaurant. I believe it recently opened there on Gilbert Rd, in between Warner Rd & Elliot Rd. It was a cute location, and the atmosphere inside was quaint. 
However, the lighting was much too bright for a restaurant, and the kitchen sounds could be heard throughout the restaurant. 
Overall, my experience was horrible. My food was cold, even though it took 5 minutes longer for my food to come out than the my 3 friends' plates. The coffee was sub par, which made a horrible first impression on me. The price seemed a little much - however, I did not take advantage of the ""pastry bar"", because nothing looked too appetizing. French toast, which I thought was pretty foolproof, did not taste good. And the bacon was covered in maple syrup and some sort of brown sugar. 
I didn't feel too alone; no one in my party had rave reviews for their meals. There were 4 of us altogether, and our food barely fit on the table, which was inconvenient and very annoying.

"I used to like Reggies, and was a regular customer, but have found the quality to really become erratic recently, which is a shame.  On it's good days, the best items to try are their comfort foods and breakfasts (all day).  

First, when pulling in, beware, as the parking lot is VERY rough, with MAJOR pot holes.  For your car's sake, GO SLOW!

One item that I've liked here is the ""old fashioned,"" which is a couple potato pancakes (served with sour cream and cheese), couple eggs, breakfast meat, and toast.   Another few that I've liked are their ruben, their Philly Cheese steak, their ciabatta club sandwich, the hot roast beef sandwich (served open face) and their chicken enchilada soup (spicy).  Also, on the weekends, in the morning, they have a ""breakfast bar"", a buffet of typical breakfast items, including eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, pancakes, waffles, corned beef hash and an assortment of fruit.

Their NY Strip steaks seem to be very hit or miss.  I've gotten some excellent steaks, cooked quite well before, but have also gotten a number that felt like half gristle.  It felt like about a 30% chance of getting a bad steak.

Talking more of the erratic quality, an example, one time when I ordered the ciabatta turkey club, I got a sandwich with soggy ciabatta bread and RAW bacon (not just undercooked, it looked like it hadn't been cooked AT ALL!).  I've also gotten eggs burned at random times, bacon burned, hashbrowns burned, etc.  Again, this is not a 100% thing, but it is enough recently to make it not worth my while coming back anytime soon unfortunately.",2,use like reggi wa regular custom found qualiti realli becom errat recent shame good day best item tri comfort food breakfast day first pull bewar park lot veri rough major pot hole car sake go slow one item like old fashion coupl potato pancak serv sour cream chees coupl egg breakfast meat toast anoth like ruben philli chees steak ciabatta club sandwich hot roast beef sandwich serv open face chicken enchilada soup spici also weekend morn breakfast bar buffet typic breakfast item includ egg sausag bacon potato pancak waffl corn beef hash assort fruit ny strip steak seem veri hit miss gotten excel steak cook quit well befor also gotten number felt like half gristl felt like chanc get bad steak talk errat qualiti exampl one time order ciabatta turkey club got sandwich soggi ciabatta bread raw bacon undercook look like cook also gotten egg burn random time bacon burn hashbrown burn etc thi thing enough recent make worth come back anytim soon unfortun

"Like one of the other reviewers I had found Reggies adequate but not recommendable from past very irregular visits, (the last has to have been a year or more ago). but we happened there on a Saturday 11 A.M.ish, and were seated promptly by the sixteen year old who was our host.  
He asked what beverages we would like and forgot one and had to get a ""refresh"" in order to fulfill, and then we waited for a waitress. 
We were told our waitress's name by our host and as always unless it's one of those un-names that just blows your socks off, like Kashikeewandamoo, it went in one ear and out the other. 
Unfortunate, because we NEVER got the opportunity to make her acquaintance. 
We waited and waited. And after a bit, decided the breakfast buffet would beat the alternative of nothing, so up we went.  Never realizing how wrong we were!
I have become over the years a less than enthusiastic buffet attendee. 
They tend to be harbingers of germs, old tired food, and some sadist is always trying to set up food far enough on the far side of the sneeze shield so as to require modified limbo dancing or monkey-arms that drag on the floor in order to get what one wants!  
So what did we have?
Absolutely the worst scrambled eggs ever!  So dry and crumbly they virtually refused to be manuvered by a fork as the sand-sized particles lacked the moisture to bind together.  It was like trying to eat flour!  
No waitress from whom to beg ketchup or hot sauce or beverage refills.
Eggs are delicate, don't cook a couple gallons at a throw so you never have to replenish,  cook small batches so the steam table doesn't dehydrate them over time,!  Also whenever possible  try to use real god^amn eggs and not the re-hydrated powdered used-to-be-eggs. 
The country potatoes or whatever they were supposed to be were equally dry, as well as burnt, and did I mention dry?  And man were they dry.  
I ended up putting sausage gravy on them hoping to find something to choke them down with and even that didn't work!  
The bacon was fine, but one does feel just a little silly filling a plate with bacon in order to flesh out one's plate!  
The owner is a very nice guy, (thin as a rail...I can see where eating here exclusively would be a weight-watcher's dream!) and when he walked by I told him we hadn't seen a waitress (we were finished dining at this point), and he said he would take care of us, refreshed our drinks and took them off the bill, so kudos to him for an attempt at a fix, but I would have been much happier had they just set off a bomb at the buffet station to blow it elsewhere, in deference to the well-being of the next hapless diner!

This used to be high atop of my list. But several cooks, and two years later, their food has gone completely downhill.

"Ok, there's something to be said about a restaurant that is two blocks away from your house.  Especially if they DO have yummy and fruity Mai Tais, and Lemongrass Martini that's LOADED with alcohol.  On Friday afternoons, it's rather a cool hangout, and great ambiance. 

Their food, however, sucks.  It's supposed to be Asian fusion, and while I am still enjoying any ""fusion"" type place (aka, a hint of ethnic, a ton of Americanization), this is rather mediocre food at best, completely vegetarian unfriendly (which is odd, given the fact that this is Madison).

Service is good though, the staff is kind and attentive.

"So far so good. I am not a big wing fan but it is on my way and a new place to try (open two months). 

I ordered the spicy boneless wings. They were crispy, hot, meaty, with no skin and little fat. That was OK with me. 

The celling is tall and the south wall is all glass letting the winter sun in. This gave the place a wide open, airy, ""Texas ice house kind of feel"" (1PM) Which was OK with me because it was a beautiful day, but a little too chilly to sit outside on the patio in shorts. 

Nice tap beer selection especially for Chandler. I had a pint of Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale. Tasted OK to me. 

The bartender was friendly and attentive. I asked her about the tap selection and she had a working knowledge of craft beer. Eventually it came out that she was a beer fan and had a kegerator in her garage (things are getting interesting...). Service was OK with me. 

I like this place so far and will go back to try a different beer and menu item.

First thing they did was put my fries and hotdogs on my tray, then put the patty on the grill for the cheeseburger. WRONG! By the time the burger and smoked meat were done, everything else was cold!
Start the burger FIRST, then start on the sandwich, then the dogs.
Fries are the LAST to go on the tray.
This advice comes from a Greek who used to work in the business.

The cook had dropped a wax paper hotdog wrap on the floor, the owner picked it up and returned it to the counter and sure enough, the cook used it. Gross! If you complain - you get ""the special"" - better to just warn others and never return.",1,recent chang owner longer asian owner visit week ago fairli larg order owner wa cash cough regist hi hand proceed help cook fill order without glove without wash hi dirti hand cook drop wax paper hotdog wrap floor owner pick return counter sure enough cook use gross complain get special better warn never return
"Everything TASTED fine when it came to flavor in itself, just isn't put together properly like it use to. I want to say that maybe it's just a new kid getting the hang of it, but like any restaurant, it's still team work and they should be watching eachothers backs.

Ordered with Uber Eats and it came A LOT faster than the displayed time :) I guess because I live less than 5 min away? lol

About 28$ total for the food before any taxes or fees. I ordered 3 items.

No utensils or condements, or noticed they're uber menu asking me if i needed any. Good thing I was at home and not at work or something. I don't recommend this food for delivery as it would probably hold it's quality better if eaten right away in the restaurant, because apparently 5 minutes is too long for this food since they don't wrap it up in proper delivery packages.

One Grilled Cheese sandwich $4.25 : This was literally just a grilled cheese sandwich I could have gotten anywhere for 2$. Regular 2 slices of white toast and kraft single cheese in the middle, and ""pan-fried?"". Would had been nice to have pan fried it in beef juice since they do make burgers there. If they want to go the classic simple route to a grilled cheese while charging this much, then they should have changed the bread and cheese to bring more value to the price, also offer extra charges for side orders like pickles, salted tomatoes, or coleslaw and make it into a meal instead of just the sandwhich, of which I won't be ordering again if it stays the same. Because it was wrapped in wax paper, the heat excaped, cooling it down to the point where the cheese nearly solidifies and no longer stretches :(

One Smoke Meat sandwich $8.95 : This is actually pretty expensive for a smoked meat sandwich. The tiny bread was funny compared to the mountain of smoked meat, but I could live with that. What concerned me was the pale color of the meat. Tasted fine at least, nice moist and flavorful, but it came with nothing else for it's price?! Wierd, not even pickles or something... It was still more on the cold side eventhough they did wrap it up with metalic paper, so I don't know what is going on there.

Medium Sized Sausage Poutine $10.45 + extra cheese $4 : They apparently think HOT DOG WEINERS are sausages?! No way, that has to be a mislead because they have ""HOT DOGS"" written in the rest of their menu. They need to edit that because I was really disapointed, eventhough they gave me a mountain of these sliced weiners. As I was digging in, I have to say I laughed when I realized that I was having a hard time finding the fries lol I literally had more cheese than fries LOL I shouldn't have ordered the extra cheese because they honor it way more than any other food place I've ever seen, it was almost cute lol. It also wasn't hot enough, so the cheese curds didn't semi-melt. The gravy sauce tasted nice, though the quantity was lacking, and the fries were on the light side and soft, when LBP use to make them a lot darker. They put it in a styrofoam packaged which sucks compared to their older aluminum pie packages, so not only did it leak, but most of it's heat was lost in the 5 min travel time, which is really fast, and like I said, the way they package their food is not meant to be delivered, it's meant to be eaten there at their location, and I don't think they realise that.

Reading some of these reviews only now... I think the changes I noticed is all these peoples fault lol #1 You're supposed to wait a good 5 min before eating poutine ! That HEAT is the finishing touch of the cooking!

To the Restaurant Owner: I know how hard it can be to please everyone. Change one thing, and the ones who previously liked it will complain lol What I wish more restaurants/fast food places would do is offer more detailed choices on orders, that way you can't really go wrong. It's not enough to just have a ""note"" customers can write to the restaurant for each order, because I can imagine some changes will effect the price and I don't want a restaurant to feel their budget is breaking.

One day I walked in here and everyone was gone. I believe that this place is now under new management and has gone down the drain dramatically.  I usually don't rate this low unless it truely deserved it, based on service, atmosphere and food.

First impressions..this place is completely dead nowadays.  We walked in and the hostess was completely glued to the tv. We were literally standing there for a good 5 mins until my brother cleared his throat lol.  We sat down and already knew what we wanted since we pretty much know the breakfast menu in and out.  We ordered two orders of the two egg breakfast with sausage with a side of bacon. She then brought out two orders one with bacon and one with sausage. We then went and explained to her we both had sausage with sides of bacon.  She then brought out another side of bacon, which looked like it was quickly microwaved and totally tasted like chewy crap.  The order of sausage? Nowhere to be found....

We then asked for our check we got charged for 2x's sides of bacon and sausage. (the sausage was suppose to be included in the breakfast)  we didn't even bother to say anything and just paid the bill.

All in all... The service was horrid.  The food has gone down the drain..What a bad experience. Back then I would have given this place a 4/5 easy.

"I get it, people get annoyed when someone says "" I'm from NY so I know good wings, pizza, subs, italian food, bagels etc"" and why doesn't Charlotte have these things? 

but generally I dismiss that because I have found all good versions of the above at some location. Nothing is ever the same as where you grow up- whether you're from NY or from Albuquerque (or insert random hometown)

But that being said Substation II really reminded me of everything a meatball sub should NOT be...

My remembrance of a meatball sub:

Served on a toasted hot garlicky Italian sub roll topped with oooey gooey mozzarella, three large homemade meatballs, and sauce that would put your Italian grandmother to shame.

What I got - Salty McSalterson's sauce and 10 mini meatballs that easily came from the frozen foods section. If that was what I wanted I would head over to HT and pick some up myself. Sadly this sub had little cheese to offer but luckily the bread was at least fresh. Do yourself a favor and for 50 cents extra head to subway and get their foot-long because essentially they are on the same caliber ...actually if I am honest, subways rivaled theirs. 

They also have ""scrap"" sandwich on their menu ...I am not sure how this is suppose to sound appealing.

"This all day breakfast and steak place is located near the main runway at Pearson on Airport Road south of Derry Road. There is lots of parking and the space is quite large. They have a wide selection of quick steak meals as well as burgers, fries, and other grilled or deep fried foods. I had a steak on a bun and although the taste was OK, the steak soaked the bun making it difficult to eat with a knife and fork. However, the overall quality was OK.

My issue with this place is the cleanliness or lack of it. The place seemed dirty with many tables still holding used plates with old food. I don't understand why that needs to be that way since the place had 3 people in there when I walked in.  I had to search for a table as far away from one that had old food and plates on it. The washroom is disgustingly dirty and I can't understand why restaurants don't pay more attention to this area.

"I entered Shabu Fondue this evening anticipating a fun and filling meal. While fondue is always fun, I found this particular meal was lacking in the filling department. My husband and I ordered the cheese course for two (swiss and emmenthal cheeses with white wine and lemon), which was really delicious with apple slices and bread chunks. We followed up with steak and chicken (served with a selection of vegs and a hot, seasoned chicken broth). In retrospect, we should have given this course a miss and ordered more of the cheese! 

The cheese course cost us $13.00 for two (portion size was very small), while the ribeye cost $15.95 and the chicken $14.95 (all prices exclusive of taxes). We both definitely felt that we would have been better off eating at The Melting Pot because, while it is more expensive, it offers better value -- bigger portions, a larger selection of meats and seafood, more choices in regards to cooking methods (oils and different kinds of broths), and fixed price menus for groups with 2+ people. 

The atmosphere at Shabu was also lacking. A restaurant's quality can often be measured by how many covers it has in an evening. On the day after Christmas Day a restaurant should be buzzing. Shabu was nearly empty.

I will say that our server was quite excellent, though. She was attentive and a great conversationalist. If the food we had consumed had been to the same standard, I would definitely have rated this restaurant with 5 stars.",2,enter shabu fondu thi even anticip fun fill meal fondu alway fun found thi particular meal wa lack fill depart husband order chees cours two swiss emmenth chees white wine lemon wa realli delici appl slice bread chunk follow steak chicken serv select veg hot season chicken broth retrospect given thi cours miss order chees chees cours cost u two portion size wa veri small ribey cost chicken price exclus tax definit felt would better eat melt pot becaus expens offer better valu bigger portion larger select meat seafood choic regard cook method oil differ kind broth fix price menu group peopl atmospher shabu wa also lack restaur qualiti often measur mani cover ha even day christma day restaur buzz shabu wa nearli empti say server wa quit excel though wa attent great conversationalist food consum standard would definit rate thi restaur star

I saw reviews on here saying there is good popcorn chicken and I work close by so I thought I'd try it out.

Got there and asked for a popcorn chicken meal....

""We don't have any cooked.""

""Ok what about a 3 piece meal?""

""Sorry we have no chicken cooked""

""What do you have ready?""

""Just wings.""

""Ok give me a wing meal with honey garlic""

""How many wings?""

""Whatever comes in the meal."" I look at the little piece of paper ""It says 6 here...give me 6.""

""What size wedges?""

""Whatever comes with the meal...a small I guess?""

Got my food and meal should be $7 with wings a pop and wedges according to their menu and I get charges $9 and change (tax I'm sure) and get no pop. I'm done though so I just leave.

Get back to my work and open my food and the wings are cold and dry. I could have gotten better from the freezer section of the No Frills nearby, and the wedges are not seasoned in any way but taste like they were tossed in flour and also cold. Obviously everything was made hours ago and just sat under a lamp.

Some pieces were sort of room temperature/COLD, some were kind of lukewarm but not warm enough to be good. This is not safe! Food must be kept at a certain temperature. It's also rude to sell food that isn't even at the proper temperature to taste good. Obviously the food had been sitting out all day and was cooked a long time ago. I would rather she told me the food was old so I could go elsewhere. The potato wedges were cold as well. If it were a normal restaurant I would storm back and return everything, but it's a weird little hole in the wall in st Jamestown and I don't need the drama. Never again!!!!

"Scruffy's is the very definition of grungy pub. I work pretty close to this pub so my meeting with this pub was bound to happen. 

Let me start of with the good things about this pub: 
-Layout: Scruffy's has a great layout, it is cozy enough to be a stop for a first date and large enough to accommodate large parties of 20+ guests. 
-Servers: they are polite, will take your order and get it right more often than not (!!) which is surprising for a pub and even crack a joke once in a while 
-Prices: drinks are cheap, assuming you don't want anything too fancy ....grungy pub = cheap (local) drinks

That is unfortunately where the good things end. If you're going to Scruffy's for food, you will be disappointed. There's no question in my mind about this fact: their food sucks. To top it off, it's overpriced. There are countless other places with better food in the same intersection. 

Finally (this is the big reason they lose points), the service here is the WORST. You're probably thinking, ""David, you said the staff is great. What gives?"". Well dear reader, although the staff is wonderful, the process this pub has set up to transfer food orders into food is very bad. 

Story time:
Went with some work buddies (about 7 of us in total) for a quick lunch and drinks. Ordered our food and began our never-ending wait. We get our drinks a little late (~15 minutes after ordering). We finish our drinks, and we're told the food will be right there ""just order another round"". We order another round. Finish the 2nd round. No drinks. It's been ~45 minutes by this time. Finally, almost an hour after ordering our food/drinks, all of our food arrives (together thank goodness). Our quick lunch+drinks turns into an hour and a half of waiting/

All in all, Scruffy's is a great place to go for a quick drink, maybe some dirty food ....and that's it.

"Frequent Disappointment.  This is yet another perfect example of a non-franchise establishment not being aware of their customer and thus dropping the proverbial ball.  Apparently under new management, there has been no change in food or environment despite the new management.

"I really wanted to believe in Cafe Soleil, but it didn't live up to my expectations. We came here twice in one day: 1. early morning for pastries before hitting the Farmer's Market and 2. to pick up some lunch before heading out of town on our way home. The first experience was ok. Hailing from France, I was secretly hoping for real French pastries. The baguette was dense and dry, the epi baguette seemed to be the best bread choice (though a tad dry), and the almond croissant, although deliciously almond-y, was quite heavy. Our second experience that day, however, left us frustrated. We ordered a house salad with grilled chicken to go. The menu described market greens and house vinaigrette-simple enough. 20 miles out of Madison we realized that we had slimy mustard greens, with mealy apples, extremely potent cheese (and believe me I can handle my cheese), and a few measly bites of chicken. $9 seemed outrageous for what looked like week old leftovers.

Last sunday, my mom and I were out on a power shopping spree at the pavillions when she said she wanted to go to Souper Salad, not wanting to i begruggingly agreed. We even dug through our back seat looking for their coupon in the sunday paper for a discount! We walked up and sat down and saw their DIRTY patio furniture... wtf?! Don't these people own a hose?! That was so dirty, I couldn't imagine trying to have a nice al fresco dining experience there! Luckily for me, it was the dirtiest part of the resturant.

We approached the door when a very loud man came and opened the door and exchanged pleasantries over and over again and was very happy to see us. Ummm... thanks? but can we atleast order our drinks first? He was a little happy. I unno - I was in a good mood, but I sorta just wanted to be left alone to eat. We got our salads and the greens were semi wilted and the cesar salad needed to be refilled but didn't :( and so I was left with some odd franken salad I threw together on my own. It wasn't that great - but that's my own doing. 

Their pasta salads and cole slaw and some of their fixin's looked very old and unappetizing! I couldn't even imagine eating them! I wished they had potato salad or carrot slaw (is that the word?) and macaroni salad... it wasn't good. But things did lighten up when I came across the soups.

I loooove soups!! They are my salvation after a hard day. I cozied up to a lil bowl of tomato based soup with mini shell pasta and veggies, it was delish! So was the Veggie Beef soup. I wish it didn't have so much onion,but I'm not a big fan of onions. and their tacos were GOOOOOD... not write home and tell everyone about it good... but very good. They remind me of the kind of tacos you make at home, out of a box but not all craptastic like how they come out when I do it. I honestly liked it. 

The cornbread was dry and my mom said her baked potato was too. The pizza looked too old to touch, so I unno about that one. 

The service was another thing... the same man, who I'm assuming is the owner always kept talking. Even when my mom said something along the lines of just wanting to enjoy our meals and we thanked him for his hospitatlity. But damn... SHUT UP! I felt like he wanted to sit down and talk shop with us... but we weren't there to meet with him... we were there to talk with one another. But he always refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly. So he got to keeep a star. 

To my fellow yelpers: if you're in the area and want fresh salads, this might not be the place for you... especially if you want to eat outside cafe style on nice clean patio furniture... but if you want a nice cozy bowl (or several like me) of soup and decent bread sticks then this place will hit the spot.

For our meal we ordered the prime rib sandwhich and the philly sandwich - one with tater tots and the other with cajun fries.  We send both our dishes back TWICE because the sandwiches were cold.  It was obvious that they just tried to microwave them because the meat came back very tough and leathery:-(  The waitress had the executive chef take care of it, in which when they came back the plates were hot as well as the food.  Both meals were just ok..I have had better sandwiches at Portillo's.  Fries and tots were nothing special - pretty sure the tots are frozen ones that they just microwave - hence the amount of ketchup needed to eat them.  Waitress was very nice through all of this.  My friend works at a restaurant and I grew up in the grocery and restaurant business - were we too critical?  No, Tatum's needs to work on their menu and their cooking.  Glad we did not order the pricey entrees.",2,went friend last night pick tatum becaus wa walk distanc condo want golf cours view sat patio wa nice order french onion soup bland stuf mushroom good meal order prime rib sandwhich philli sandwich one tater tot cajun fri send dish back twice becaus sandwich cold wa obviou tri microwav becaus meat came back veri tough leatheri waitress execut chef take care came back plate hot well food meal ok better sandwich portillo fri tot noth special pretti sure tot frozen one microwav henc amount ketchup need eat waitress wa veri nice thi friend work restaur grew groceri restaur busi critic tatum need work menu cook glad order pricey entre

"Tried breakfast, lunch, and dinner here, and the food was terrible.  The only nice features are the friendly dinner staff and the nice golf course view during the day.  Since those two features can be easily obtained elsewhere, I would not recommend this place.

Breakfast- the eggs and sausages were fine, but the oatmeal was overcooked, and service was completely lacking despite the fact that the restaurant was not even half full.  

Steak salad- ordered the steak medium rare.  It came overly smoked, completely overcooked, and tasted like beef jerky.  The spinach was also not fresh.

Vegetable soup- tasted fine, but nothing special. 

Chicken Caesar- the dressing was fine, but the lettuce was somewhat blackened.  The chicken was also blackened and overcooked.  

Tater Tots- tasted fine, although a bit dry.

Also, to ruin the night they had one guy poorly playing covers on an electric guitar, what was the point of that?

"This business has closed, and judging by the ""sheriff's sale"" postings, it will not be reopening... 

Gone is the pleasure of the proprietors and waitstaff x-raying your wallet and checking how expensive your shoes look as you enter, that is, if they pay you any attention at all. No more sitting drinkless as the only customers during ""happy"" hour, while the owner shmoozes a liquor vendor (a woman who repeatedly used the word ""zing-fen-dale,"" no joke) in the comfy lounge seats next to you.

"Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I'll try to be fair though but I'm writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing. So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.  

Texas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.

Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :( 

Entrees.

Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:) 

Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned. 

Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.

Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible: 

Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.

"Went on a week night for an early dinner - there were not that many tables occupied.  First off, as soon as we walked through the door we were hit with a bad odor (it smelled like a sewage/ventilation problem?).  Having been there several times before, I knew not to expect ambiance and that is one thing, but it could really stand a good cleaning (everything just looked like it would be sticky to touch, the table had something that looked like a dead bug stuck to it, walls were splattered with who knows what, and the menus were FILTHY -  I could go on....).  

We started with a cup of french onion soup with a side of french bread (both delicious).  For the main dish we split the chicken crepe and chicken salad sandwich.  The sandwich was very good.  The crepe was really very, very rich.  Did not like that the crepe was folded and not stuffed, and there was too much sauce for our taste.  I have had this before but probably would not order it again.  Ordered a plain crepe with sugar.  This took FOREVER to come out.  In the meantime the waitress was nowhere to be found - she did not offer a refill on my coffee, nor did she clear the dishes.  There were only a handful of tables occupies, and I counted at least 3 females and 1 or 2 male staff, so as far as I was concerned there was no excuse.  When the dessert finally came, dirty dishes still on table, I asked for a coffee refill but never did get it.  And there was no apology for the wait.  The dessert crepe itself was so-so - soggy on the bottom from moisture.  My family said that they much prefer the crepes I make at home.

Overall, a disappointment, as I would sooo love a decent crepe place nearby.",2,went week night earli dinner mani tabl occupi first soon walk door hit bad odor smell like problem sever time befor knew expect ambianc one thing could realli stand good clean everyth look like would sticki touch tabl someth look like dead bug stuck wall splatter know menu filthi could go start cup french onion soup side french bread delici main dish split chicken crepe chicken salad sandwich sandwich wa veri good crepe wa realli veri veri rich like crepe wa fold stuf wa much sauc tast thi befor probabl would order order plain crepe sugar thi took forev come meantim waitress wa nowher found offer refil coffe clear dish onli hand tabl occupi count least femal male staff far wa concern wa excus dessert final came dirti dish still tabl ask coffe refil never get wa apolog wait dessert crepe wa soggi bottom moistur famili said much prefer crepe make home overal disappoint would sooo love decent crepe place nearbi

"This place was fun and tries very hard to please....but there are a few drawbacks and it falls short of many Montreal restaurants which easily get three stars. Most of the portions were way too small more suitable for people on diets. I ordered a salmon and shrimp main dish as part of the Tabledote, it was tasty and nicely presented on cool plate of black slate. Maybe there was one shrimp sliced in half and two or three bites of salmon on the skewer and that was it. Another skewer would have  satisfied. The beet and goat cheese salad was very light on the cheese about a teaspoon. My friends plates looked skimpy too with the exception of the steak frites. A glass of wine was included with the dinner but it had a few fruit flies floating in it. The server politely replaced it, but, the damage was already done.  In an attempt to be loungy and ""tres cool"" some housy/techno music was blasting everywhere making table conversation difficult.

Wow I had such a terrible experience here. I took my 80 year old parents here because my mom wanted to treat us out for dinner.  The young waiter was extremely rude and impatient with us. We took a bit of time to order and asked him questions about what he recommended and he acted very annoyed. There were only 2 other tables taken in the restaurant at the time. Our food was nothing special and below our expectations given the previous reviews.

"I remember when this chain was pretty new, and the location in Albuquerque served up giant bowls of hot delicious noodles with perfect sauce. The mac & cheese... to die for. It was like the Chipotle of noodle places... fast, easy, fresh (-tasting, at least) and delicious, enough food to last you for a couple future meals. 

But that was like, 5 years ago. And when I recently went to this location I was sooo disappointed. The portions have shrunk drastically. My alfredo sauce was chunky, the butter separated into a cold greasy puddle halfway through the meal. The noodles were a little too firm. And it was too expensive for such a lackluster bowl o pasta.

"Ho-hum. Why do we always wind up at average chain restaurants. I'm firmly placing blame on someone else, namely my partner. I like to plan, he doesn't, so we wind up at average or less than average chain restaurants. 

We tried to go see a movie late this afternoon but it winds up everything we wanted to see was sold out. So we perused Sport Mart for a while, got a couple deals and then he said: ""I'm really hungry."" So it was between White Chocolate Grill and McGrath's Fish House. Since we'd been to White Chocolate and McGrath's would give me another opporunity to write a review on yelp we decided on McGrath's. This was not the better of the two choices.

They seated us in a cavernous dining room that was empty save for two other groups of diners. In addition the room was very warm. I must depart from the review to let you know my partner is HOT, and not just in the way your dirty minds are thinking. So, shortly after being seated we're both very uncomfortable.

The good news is the service from our waiter Adam was great. The food, well it was just okay. We started with the Calamari Rings which were, you guessed it, just okay. I ordered Wood Fired Salmon and he ordered a King's Platter. The Salmon was far from wood-fired, grilled with some wood flavored seasoning sprinkled on it, I can do that at home. My partner's platter was also just okay. He said there's no reason to come back here. I have to say I must concur.

"Up on the second floor of the Pacific Mall, this small counter restaurant is reputed to make some really good food for affordable prices.  It is the no frills of no frills.

When I got there it was late in the evening and about an hour or two from the mall closing.  It was the busiest of all of the counters in that section and price range.  The P.Mall is cramped at the best of times and it felt that way with even half the capacity in the area.

Now the food looks good and there were so many selections that it was difficult to choose.  I saw they had shrimp in lobster sauce over rice.  It is a simple dish but I had not had it in ages so I ordered it.  

Not how my dad used to make it and it was a little on the salty side, which I can do without.  In spite of that, I am not ready to give up on this little cubby hole though.  I'll be back and hopefully they will give me reason to lift the review to something more respectable.

I'm hoping it was an 'off dish' for them and that it will not happen again.

"Definitely not an accommodating place at all. When I first came to this restaurant, I asked them if they can substitute their meat in a fried noodle dish with tofu instead. I told them that I was willing to pay extra for this substitution and was willing to wait longer for them to prepare it. Keep in mind that this was late afternoon and there were maybe only 5 other people in total in the food court, most of whom were already eating their meals and the worker was just lounging around. 

He then told me that he could not substitute any meal with tofu instead of meat. First of all, tofu is cheaper than meat and I was willing to pay extra for it. Second of all, the restaurant that I went to next, RIGHT BESIDE this place, Casa Formosa, not only gladly substituted the meat for tofu for any of their dishes, but also let me choose what kind of tofu I wanted. 

I'm extremely disappointed since I know many Chinese vegetarians in the area who have converted due to their religion. I will point out that they do have 2 vegetarian dishes, however, having only 2 makes it get boring real quickly and it's not like adding tofu to the pan instead of meat is hard.

"Let me set the mood for you: 

It's the first cool night in Phoenix in 17 years (at least it seems that way) cool breezes blow across the desert landscape, dry air has set in, The Redsox, Indians, and D'backs all have a 2 to 0 lead in their respective series, Manny Ramirez Just hit a 3 run walk off home run in the bottom of the 9th to win the Redsox play-off game, the Yankees lost in 11 innings!! 

I don't think I could ask for a more perfect night, like God came down for 1 second and said ""Hey, I'll make all your dreams come true buddy.""

Enter Sugar Daddy's....

A few ex-coworkers invited me here, and since it was close I head over after the Sox game concluded. I am not  a big fan of Scottsdale bars in general, but went to see some friends. I even brought a sweatshirt for a friend per her request, who was ""chilly"" (see the above description of the weather)First let me say,  the patio is pretty cool, you can sit outside and enjoy the weather, being next to Scottsdale Rd, isn't so great, as wanna-be Hell's Angels cruise by on their bikes, buzzing the place like Tom Cruise in Top Gun. All that aside they had live music, basically A Dashboard Confessionals style, emo-acoustic  band. They were entertaining. The drink prices are reasonable, though a friend of mine (a girl) was billed for 21 miller Lites, which she claimed, ""was impossible to drink in 4 hours"" I said, ""well it is Miller Lite, which is basically seltzer water, with a splash of hops and barely, so you really could of had 21 beers"" She proceeded to drive herself home, you do the math. 
For the crowd, it would be what you'd expect, but a little better than what you see in old town Scottsdale, people were more down to Earth here, and pretty cool and laid back. I had no problem with the crowd, it was mellow. 
So as my friends decided to leave I ventured into the ""labyrinth  inside, and let me say this place is huge. The decor is like something out  of a Robert Rodriguez movie (insert from Dusk Till Dawn) and The set of The Munsters.  To me it had no real identity and conflicted completely with the patio style of Mexican Cantina. Inside there are many areas to get lost in, and dark corners were I could imagine horny Scottsdalians making out, and participating in heavy petting. After locating the bathroom, using my onboard GPS system, I decided to sit at the patio bar to finish my drink. I struck up a conversation with 2 of the female bartenders, as they were attractive, and emo/punk/tatoo'd/angst looking. (I can't help myself with girls like this sometimes) So one of The Donnas (reference to the rock-band of all girls that look the same) started to explain to me she spoke sign language, and could communicate this way. As we were talking she became more and more annoying, it is hard to believe that someone could sign, and be annoying, but it happened. I spoke to her, and found her to be rude, and somewhat obnoxious, it really just solidified my opinion of this place and left me with a bad taste in my mouth, like waking up in the morning after you had some cool-ranch Dorititos before bed. You try hard to remove the taste, brushing, mouth-wash, flossing, etc, but it just stays with you until you eat lunch.....Unfortunately  I haven't eaten lunch yet.",2,let set mood first cool night phoenix year least seem way cool breez blow across desert landscap dri air ha set redsox indian lead respect seri manni ramirez hit run walk home run bottom win redsox game yanke lost inning think could ask perfect night like god came second said hey make dream come true buddi enter sugar daddi invit sinc wa close head sox game conclud big fan scottsdal bar gener went see friend even brought sweatshirt friend per request wa chilli see abov descript weather first let say patio pretti cool sit outsid enjoy weather next scottsdal rd great hell angel cruis bike buzz place like tom cruis top gun asid live music basic dashboard confession style band entertain drink price reason though friend mine girl wa bill miller lite claim wa imposs drink hour said well miller lite basic seltzer water splash hop bare realli could beer proceed drive home math crowd would expect littl better see old town scottsdal peopl earth pretti cool laid back problem crowd wa mellow friend decid leav ventur labyrinth insid let say thi place huge decor like someth robert rodriguez movi insert dusk till dawn set munster real ident conflict complet patio style mexican cantina insid mani area get lost dark corner could imagin horni scottsdalian make particip heavi pet locat bathroom use onboard gp system decid sit patio bar finish drink struck convers femal bartend attract look ca help girl like thi sometim one donna refer girl look start explain spoke sign languag could commun thi way talk becam annoy hard believ someon could sign annoy happen spoke found rude somewhat obnoxi realli solidifi opinion thi place left bad tast mouth like wake morn doritito befor bed tri hard remov tast brush floss etc stay eat lunch unfortun eaten lunch yet
"If this place doesn't serve as a case study of what ""wasted opportunity"" and ""terrible management"" looks like, then show me another place like Sugar Daddy's that frighteningly resembles Chernobyl 1986.

I chuckle now because several times, years ago, I would wait in a line to get into this place -- not on my own accord, mind you -- but because some of my buddies thought this place was the killer.  In fact, this place would be freaking AWESOME if it was plopped down on 3rd Street and Roosevelt.

Granted, I still wouldn't go if this place was set in Old Town, but at least they wouldn't be gasping for air while the distant, populated beach of Goldwater shrugs a casual shoulder.

The meat isn't char grilled, but steamed on a flat-top and is greasy/wet enough that the little tortillas break apart before you get halfway through the first one.  I ended up dumping the mix into a pile, tossing the tortillas, and eating it like cereal.

"Because of its location (inside Playhouse Square) people attend Acappella for one reason: to make it to their show on time.

In the past I've gone to Acappella and I've had decent Italian-American food for a fair price, and I've always made it to the show for curtain. Yesterday, however, I went to Acappella to see a 1PM show with my boyfriend and grandmother, and I had to leave in disgust without eating lunch. 

We arrived at 11:45, and the restaurant wasn't full. However, the wait staff appeared to be in their own world and they didn't even provide us with menus (we had to go up to the hostess stand and take them ourselves). At 12:30 I asked the waitress for the ETA on our 2 pasta dishes and bowl of soup, and she informed me that the cook hadn't even started preparing them. By 12:45 we still hadn't been served and left.

In total the three of us each had some coffee and a slice of bread before the show. At no point did the wait staff let us know that they weren't able to serve us in a timely fashion, and they didn't even bother to provide us with gift cards or anything else to salvage their reputation.

The only reason I'm giving Acappella 2 stars is because in the past they have done a good job, and I'm hoping that yesterday was a fluke for them.

"We usually frequent another chinese restaraunts in our area, but after receiving a flyer in the mail with a coupon we decided to try Oakridge Phoenix....horrible idea.

We ordered spring rolls and pork gyozas/dumpling.  Both were very fried to a dark brown making them quite dry.  The dumpling filling was an odd flavor unlike any I've had before.  The spring roll was hideously sweet, from what I don't know.  Neither had a fresh vegetable taste, they were more like they had been mixed with the meat ages ago and became muddy.  

We ordered Pork Egg Foo Young  which was literally just egg, carrots, peas and sprouts.  Though the veggies were at least fresh the whole thing was devoid of any seasoning or flavor.  Also most places serve it with some kind of sauce, there was none.  Just a huge hunk of egg and veggies, that's it.  

We also ordered almond soo gai.  Again this was fried within a shade of being black.  The chicken inside was so dry it was not edible.  I would guess they were frozen for far too long and acquired freezer burn.  

Finally the coupon was for a free order of Chicken fried  rice.  It was literally rice and chicken with a few peas sprinkled on top.  Again no flavor, no seasoning and the chicken was dry as dry can be.  The rice was oddly plump and hard.  

Needless to say we will not try this place again.  Clearly they are cutting corners by over freezing food that doesn't get rotated frequently enough.

"First off, let me explain what the HELL I was doing at a horrible chain restaurant (I don't even feel comfortable calling this pre-fab big box pre-frozen place a ""restaurant""). I just started a job in Office Space near by on Elliot and needed a place I could get to, get served and get out within an hour with my friend on my dinner break. As we cruised Elliot, the lights blinking of Wal Marts, Costcos, JcPennys, and all the gruesome fast food chains like a garish consumerist Las Vegas, I decided on Chillis b/c at least their memory had not been horrendous. 

The last time I ate at one of these, it was TEN years ago-when I was 17. It was next to Borders Books in NJ, and I thought it was kind of sophisticated (hey, I had been brought up on Malls, okay?). 

The decor of this place confused me. The bar is right at the entrance with a supremely low ceiling. Seated at a tall table with some plush booths on the side and surrounded by five televisions, the waiter was fast with the iced teas. The bar was actually designed kind of cool, with beers in ice on the bar, kind of like the practice of picking out lobsters out of tanks. The drinks were disgusting looking (not our iced teas-they were fine-if served in PLASTIC beer mugs) in the menu, with all drinks mysteriously splashing and semen-resembling.

The decor...okay, there were also windows that looked out back into the restaurant...I mean I don't understand. Is it supposed to be bohemian? Like a ""mexican shack""? Country? The decor confuses me instead of comforts me. I feel like I am in a bad stage set of a western town, like a rompus room for tourist's kids or something.

We ended up with Southwestern Egg Rolls (which has like pureed chicken in it) and I did sneak a taste (yummy in the worst for you way-better than I remembered-but guarenteed to make my vegetarian stomach shrivel up and die) and the chocolate molten cake, which was OUT OF CONTROL. A fucking huge chocolate cake with hot fudge stuff inside a huge dent, with a large vanilla scoop of ice cream encased in a hard chocolate shell. 

These things were fine, standard, but expensive. Do people realize they are paying like 7 bucks for an appetizer and like 6 bucks for a dessert they could get a LOT more for their money at an independent ""real"" restaurant?

The stars go to the service-all nice, helpful, and not in a scary generic way.

"I visited Dish 1st week of September. The one thing I realized about this place was how overpriced everything was. Breakfast burrito - $9? Grilled chicken that was laying out in the deli  (no sauce or condiments) $8? There is another place like Dish that sells the exact same chicken for $5. I order the pizza at the restaurant and it was a really salty. I should have just went to Domino's.

I really had a hard time believing the prices they are charging for a grilled sandwich (almost $10) to pasta. Are you kidding me? Then I realized I'm in Scottsdale where people will eat anything in front of them as long as that place looks trendy (see Olive and Ivy). 

The concept is pretty good. You can pick up stuff for home if you don't have time to make anything. I think the prices are restaurant prices for a take out place. 

I think the location of Dish will attract considerable traffic. It's a huge place that offers pick up and a sit down restaurant. Most of the employees knew what they were talking about and were friendly. But, it's vastly overpriced for what they offer.

Update 9/12/07: People have said that the food is pricey, but it's Scottsdale...so it comes with the territory. That's what's wrong with most people. Location should not justify the prices, the food should. Actually, I don't mind spending money if the food is worth it (in fact, my favorite local seafood restaurant is Wildfish, not inexpensive). 

But, the food is alright compared to the prices. If you're a bit lazy and can't make a sandwich yourself at home, then by all means..spend $10+ for a sandwich here.  I think this is definitely catering to the right crowd.  This place is a larger, overpriced LGO with marginal food. I've tried the pizza, grilled chicken sandwich, burrito, and sushi. All were OK.  Perhaps, I am fortunate that my client/work pays whenever I go there. I think there are other places I would go to spend my OWN money.

I think Dish will do well because of it's location and because it is Scottsdale..where most people don't have a discerning taste bud.  

One positive thing I will say is that it's a quick, easy place to get a meal and the employees seem knowledgeable about what they sell. So, if you're not in the mood to cook or even sure what to eat, but want a myriad of overpriced choices then Dish is for you. 

Again, this is a personal opinion.

"I so wanted to like this place.  Stopped in on a Thursday night, giddy with dessert excitement.  It took awhile for someone to acknowledge us and take our order.  The waitstaff seemed stressed, annoyed, and inexperienced.  But at this point I'm still thinking it's all going to be worth it.  What a disappointment.  The desserts we tried were bland and dry.  I tend to like things that aren't overly sweet, so it's not that I was expecting an explosion of sweetness and flavor, but I was expecting *some* flavor.  Especially for the price!  Maybe they have something worth eating, but I'm not going to waste any more of my time or money to find out.

"I've always wondered about this place and finally tried it out with a friend who has been before.

To begin, you should be coming here with a truckstop diner mentality. Don't expect a hipstery brunch joint serving chorizo bennies with a side of duck fat avocado fries (oh man, i don't know if that's even a thing but i want it to be now!) This is a truckstop diner in all its glory. Large portions, probably oversalted food, very efficient service (truckstop servers are my favourite for this reason), retro diner ambience (but not forced retro), and neverending coffee.

I got the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes, gravy, and steamed veg. Very salty, even for a sodiumphile like myself. Also tried the pierogies and sausage which were alright, as well as the hamburger steak.

Probably a great option for those lazy weekend mornings when you feel like going out for a huge, greasy, breakfast but don't want to line up with everyone else for the newest, cool, brunch place. +1 for credit card pay phones at some tables and the wall of stuffed husky toy animals at the front.",2,alway wonder thi place final tri friend ha befor begin come truckstop diner mental expect hipsteri brunch joint serv chorizo benni side duck fat avocado fri oh man know even thing want thi truckstop diner glori larg portion probabl oversalt food veri effici servic truckstop server favourit thi reason retro diner ambienc forc retro neverend coffe got chicken fri steak mash potato gravi steam veg veri salti even sodiumphil like also tri pierogi sausag alright well hamburg steak probabl great option lazi weekend morn feel like go huge greasi breakfast want line everyon el newest cool brunch place credit card pay phone tabl wall stuf huski toy anim front

"While John's (our server) performance was impeccable, I doubt we'll be returning any time soon. My crab cake was VERY fishy tasting and Tuesday's only offered a very blah cocktail sauce - no teriyaki, soy or other flavor masker. My bride's chicken fresco was noticeably dry and her favorite vegetable, steamed broccoli, was not warm enough to melt the ""butter"" that John served after being asked for it. Her mashed cauliflower (which she couldn't bring herself to insist I try) was ""not quite what I remember"".

We didn't partake of the salad bar ... it was nicely presented but compared to Dessey's or a Sizzler it was seriously lacking.

Bottom line, if we get another ($10 max) 2 for 1 coupon we might return for a (see previous ratings) highly rated turkey burger. On the other hand, In-N-Out  is hard to resist when it come to burgers.

"Breakfast!!

Nothing to WOW about.
Although their Specialty Pancakes look impressive as hell.
There is a Notice that these meals (even omelettes) may require an 18min cooking time over your basic bacon and eggs. Just an fyi.

Party of one. No counter to kick back at. Bummer.
Great service though. They are all over you, and very nice. Monica was a sweetheart.
Especially with what the servers are contending with......and you too if you come here.

Tuesday morning 10:00am. Waited only 5mins for my table.
Once seated I'm surrounded by a couple screaming kids, several folks (who remember phonebooths)  chatting away about taking their garbage cans out, or having been to Phoenix already, etc., LOUDLY.
All the while ingnoring those right in front of them? I'm finding it sad that older people have discovered public use of a cell phone too. They make loud speaking people louder.

Food is certainly worthy here. Except maybe the $3 small orange juice. Maybe even the $15 total which includes a $2 tip. And can most certainly get higher. I had a simple breakfast.

Will I come again? Probably not as a party of one. With my folks, or a ""morning after"" episode of a fine romance? Majority rules will have to win that one.

"This place is right up the street. I have never been before, and at this point I never will again. I ordered take out. Lasagna, a child size gnocchi, and chicken and rice soup. I ordered these based on what I found online. Basically good reviews. The lasagna was 5 layers of noodles, meaning noodle on top of noodle, under the 5 layers of noodles..yes, just noodles, was a thin layer of ricotta and another noodle. Nothing between the layers of just noodles, not even sauce. On top was some cheese baked golden brown, deceiving. The menu states meat sauce, 2 little flecks of meat is what I am looking at. I took 2 bites, and I stopped eating it. I went back to the kitchen to check the rest, thinking maybe I just got the end piece and the filling fell out. No. Next I try the gnocchi, chewy is an understatement. They were also hard. Not to confuse the al dente of the lasagna. This dish had one tiny piece of meat visible in the sauce. Smaller than a grain of rice. I didn't even try the chicken and rice soup yet, as I was so disappointed. I have never returned food, or even complained. I was hungry, and disappointed. I just called the place, and the women who answered told me I really should have called last night when I ordered. I picked up at 840p-845p. They close at 10. I should have called last night, because she can't do anything for me now. I don't want you to do anything for me, I wanted to express my opinion (something I never do) on how this food is not even edible. I was told I could call tomorrow when the boss (who I believe may be the cook) is in, but she can't do anything for me. Again, I stated I didn't want anything. I was told no one else ever complained about the lasagna. I said, according to what I found online (however most reviews are older) that is exactly why I ordered it, as I was thinking the same. The women up front were nice last night, today on the phone wasn't exactly the same. I am unsure if she just thought I was trying to get my items for free, or what the case was.

"Tail gators.. tail gaters.. whatever, just a gimmick. I sit down around 8pm, it seemed that they were running some kind of Ohio state b-ball special.  Because patrons either had been there a long time, or have super low tolerances.  I sat down at the corner of the bar. Open seats to the left and the right.  It took  10 minutes to be acknowledged (note: 2 bartenders, 10 to 11 people at the bar). Now it was probably 5 minute because I was particularly parched.  The general feeling was not friendly during the entire stay.  Felt like they tend to regulars.  I ordered the calzone.  For the price, this was a hell of a deal.  As far as taste it was better than the price.  I will not say the flavor was something great, but it was border line epic in size.

"15 miles from the Las Vegas strip this place claims to have Iowa Pork Tenderloin Sandwiches and since it's been more than 5 years 
since we had one we were determined to make the drive. When we arrived it looked very promising a large crowd was gathering next door for the car show and once we entered the place had a very cool atmosphere with 
TV's on every wall,classic 50's 
boothes and all kinds of car memorabilia. Plus 
theres a bar & game room upstairs. There was no wait & plenty of seating when we arrived at 6:00 pm. After we were seated , 20 minutes later a teenage waitress came to take our drink order, 20 minutes later she came back with the drinks and took our order. We ordered 4 sliders,Fried Cheese, Pork Tenderloin & Country Fried Steak Sandwiches. A little pricier than the menu we had found on the 
interent but still fairly reasonable. While we waited for our appetizer we saw several disgruntled patrons complaining about the slow service & leaving. After an hour of waiting we still had NOT seen our waitress for a refill or explanation. There were at most 30-40 patrons in the place at this time. The people sitting across from us had to have waited 20 minutes for there bill and finally a 
waitress brought them every unpaid check and asked which one was theirs, the man left exact cash for the check & voiced quite loudly to no one in particular he wasn't leaving any damn tip-for what? On 2 
occasions while we were waiting with our EMPTY glasses on the edge of the table as a CLEAR sign we needed MORE to drink the waitresses would turn tail and run before they made eye contact and had to DO THEIR JOB!! Finally fed up with waiting for NO APPARENT REASON we decided to give up and go somewhere that actually serves their customers. We approached the waitress to find out what the problem was she laughed & said ""it's crazy in here"" with no apology or explanation for the ABSURDLY long wait. HELL we've waited an HOUR to get into a place with NO problem but an HOUR to see your waitress after you've ordered-NEVER and we eat out 3-4 times a week! To say it was BAD service is an understatement. We never had a chance to try any of the food but without a doubt there was NO way it would have been good enough to compensate for the 
atrocious service. The only way I would recommend this place is if it were FREE & they were POURING booze down your throat while you wait.

I had passed this place on the way home one night and vowed to see what it was about.  I checked out their website -- not too shabby!

Hubby and I decided to give it a go the other night.

What a disappointment.  I can't even articulate about how overcooked my food was or how meagre the service was.  I practically begged for water and silverware.

Words cannot describe how angry I felt when I left.  The food, the service, utterly disappointing.

I ordered their Cedar Plank Salmon.  The salmon was so overdone that the edges were past the point of crisp -- they were burnt.  I asked our server if I could please get one that was not quite so charred.  I swear she rolled her eyes at me.

The sides were the only highlight of that meal.  Hubby's meal was ""ok"" by his standards, but I could see a stream of resentment building in him.

It was a Thursday night, not too packed, but busy enough.  Our server was more concerned with her chatter with the other servers.  It's one thing to have friends at work, but you don't neglect the customer.  I saw that we were not the only ones who bore the brunt of her bad service.

When my plate came back, she slammed the dish down so hard that the salmon almost fell onto the table.

Surly much?

I can't give this place a good recommendation.  Their beer selection was ho hum as was their mixed drinks.

They'd reupholstered the booths with the torn vinyl. They'd gotten rid of the cracked & torn vinyl red & white striped tablecloths. Still cracked & old formica but it didn't seem as dirty.

As far as the food, I got a bacon cheeseburger that was just not very good. Ok, but nothing special at all. The fries weren't great either. In years past, I was a big fan of the plastic cheese in the heated cheese fountain but not so much either. After it cools a bit, it's just nasty.

"I get my hair cut next door to this place and have thought about eating there a few times after I noticed their sign that says, ""Home of the best Cuban Sandwich in Charlotte,"" and finally did this afternoon after reading a couple of positive reviews about the place.

I have to say I was disappointed.

I have had a lot of Cuban sandwiches in my time, and have even gone so far as to roast my own pork, go to Compare's Foods for Cuban bread, and making my own (I'm a culinary student).  The sandwich at Carolina Grill has all the components -- the ham, the pork, the cheese, the mustard, pickle and Cuban bread -- but nothing was really very special.  My idea of a good Cuban has a meaty, chewiness to it -- thick slices of home-roasted pork, slices of good ham.

The ""roast pork"" here was, as the last reviewer said, some kind of pulled pork and not sliced.  In fact, it looked and tasted suspiciously like a commercial product of Carolina-style barbecue pork.  I noticed they have both ""Cuban Roast Pork"" and Barbecue Sandwiches on the menu, which makes me wonder maybe they started out using sliced roast pork and they switched to the barbecue.  The restaurant seemed a bit slow, and when places start cutting food costs because of that it is a vicious downhill cycle that leads to no good.  The ham also didn't impress -- the best Cubans I've had have ham that was cut from a chunk, like Honey Ham.  This place uses thin processed ham -- like the Danish baked ham that comes in rectangular plastic packages hanging next to the Oscar Meyers.  

I also had an appetizer of Ham Croquettes that were a frozen commercial product.  It wasn't bad, but I'd suggest the ""chef straight from Cuba,"" as one of the co-owners described, keep the box low so diners can't see it from the dining room.  Something like that tells me a lot about a place.  The chef has nothing to do in the afternoon slow period, but instead of making a batch of home-made croquettes from scratch to freeze (probably saving food cost too) he uses a commercial frozen product.

I think this place has the potential to be a good spot with home-made Cuban food, but they need to commit to making the food from scratch as much as possible instead of cutting corners with commercial products whenever they can.  And if they really want to push their Cuban Sandwich as the best (not a bad ideal at all), then they need to make it the best, starting with roasting the pork and using good ham.  More pickles woudn't hurt either.",2,get hair cut next door thi place thought eat time notic sign say home best cuban sandwich charlott final thi afternoon read coupl posit review place say wa disappoint lot cuban sandwich time even gone far roast pork go compar food cuban bread make culinari student sandwich carolina grill ha compon ham pork chees mustard pickl cuban bread noth wa realli veri special idea good cuban ha meati chewi thick slice pork slice good ham roast pork wa last review said kind pull pork slice fact look tast suspici like commerci product barbecu pork notic cuban roast pork barbecu sandwich menu make wonder mayb start use slice roast pork switch barbecu restaur seem bit slow place start cut food cost becaus viciou downhil cycl lead good ham also impress best cuban ham wa cut chunk like honey ham thi place use thin process ham like danish bake ham come rectangular plastic packag hang next oscar meyer also appet ham croquett frozen commerci product wa bad suggest chef straight cuba one describ keep box low diner ca see dine room someth like tell lot place chef ha noth afternoon slow period instead make batch croquett scratch freez probabl save food cost use commerci frozen product think thi place ha potenti good spot cuban food need commit make food scratch much possibl instead cut corner commerci product whenev realli want push cuban sandwich best bad ideal need make best start roast pork use good ham pickl woud hurt either

"this location i visited today was less than satisfactory, the employees showed hostility and lack of caring in the work place. specifically one employee by the name of margarita. what had a happened was my chilli cheese frys that i upgraded to was pitiful. just a few drops of chili, and a few sprinkles of cheese. hardly an upgrade if you ask me, so i took it to the counter and asked for a refund of the fries or for them to be replaced. i did ask sternly, but politely and the employee came at me with an attitude saying ""sir don't get an attitude with me, i will get you new fries, but you don't come at me and  talk to me like that"" i just agreed with the employee because im sure she would have just been more rude. she could have simply said ""ok, im sorry, let me get you a new one"" not only that , her and her cook knowingly didnt put the correct amount of chili and thought it would be ok to just skimp me on it because they didnt want to change the bag or refill the chili. that just makes this company and this location look bad. i dont mind paying extra for a quality burger and fries as most do at your restaurant, but i would like to atleast get my bang for my buck, i mean  the chili cheese fries basically looked like a regular fries in a box with a few shreds of cheese. even after they gave me the fries, she continued to glare at me in an intimidating fashion. no person should experience what i just did, i will not return to this location. this isnt the first time this location didnt show respect or care in the work place, ive had other instances at this location. their staff definitely needs to pep talk on customer service. not only that, every time i get a burger, its luke warm or a bit cold. this place is no bueno, i give it one star for lack of manners and respect for customers",1,thi locat visit today wa satisfactori employe show hostil lack care work place specif one employe name margarita happen wa chilli chees fri upgrad wa piti drop chili sprinkl chees hardli upgrad ask took counter ask refund fri replac ask sternli polit employe came attitud say sir get attitud get new fri come talk like agre employe becaus im sure would rude could simpli said ok im sorri let get new one onli cook knowingli didnt put correct amount chili thought would ok skimp becaus didnt want chang bag refil chili make thi compani thi locat look bad dont mind pay extra qualiti burger fri restaur would like atleast get bang buck mean chili chees fri basic look like regular fri box shred chees even gave fri continu glare intimid fashion person experi return thi locat thi isnt first time thi locat didnt show respect care work place ive instanc thi locat staff definit need pep talk custom servic onli everi time get burger luke warm bit cold thi place bueno give one star lack manner respect custom

"I have lived within a half mile of this Carl's Jr. Store #1101078 for over 20 years. I was excited to live close to a Carl's Jr. as I loved their food when I lived in California.
The first 2 or 3 times it was a little less than ok, and thought it just was an off day for them. Unfortunately, the food never got any better, and the service was lacking. Ordered a Famous Star, drink, and Zucchini once and came to the window. Gave them a $20 and they gave me a couple bucks back. I said how much was my order? They said with the 4 order of zucchini.... what? I wanted 1 order.They said to come back the next day for a refund, as there were no managers at the store until the next day WTH! 
The place burned down about 4 yrs ago, and they rebuilt it. The family and I thought we would try it again since it was new and fresh after the rebuilt. I punish myself about twice a year at this store hoping that something has change, but always come out disappointed. 
I eat at Carl's a couple times a month, but this one I avoid.
My wife called and wanted chicken tenders and zucchini on my way home. So I was close to home instead of the one by my work, so I tried this store again.
My wife said the food seemed quite cold after the long wait for the chicken tenders, and started to eat.
The reason was the chicken was raw!, I'm not talking under cooked, I'm talking RAW CHICKEN.
I called the phone number on the receipt over and over again as it would disconnect after 2 minutes and no answer. After calling for 20 minutes straight and no answer, I figured I would do my first yelp review since they do not want to here from me.

"This review is about the employees, not the food, didn't get to have any..

I came to this Carl's Jr after driving straight through from San Diego. I also drove 20 extra minutes from my hotel to come here.. I had double checked the hours (closed at 2 am), and debated if I even wanted to go out of my way for food. 
On Monday night, October 30th, at 1:30 am, I arrived at this Carl's Jr. As I was driving up, I noticed a car reversing out of the drive though... uh-oh. 
I am a human being. I can completely understand that on a Monday night it would be dead. Not having any customers for hours, and the employees decide to close early and go home. I get it, not cool, but I get it. 
I was pretty upset that night though, as you could probably understand. I was going to leave a note so the openers knew that they had lost money by closing early. (Not that that was the best decision, but this is the story.) I was going to wedge it in the drive through window; as I touched it, it slid open about a half inch, even though it was still locked.
This noise, then prompted the employees, hiding in the back, to come see what it was. THE EMPLOYEES WERE THERE THE WHOLE TIME. The lights were off, they hadn't answered the phone when I called prior to coming, and they said nothing at the drive through intercom. They were shocked to see me standing outside my car. I held up my note for them, which called them lazy, and said something to the effect of ""I just want some food"". They proceeded to laugh at me. Well, I got one of them in a photo. 

To consumers reading this, I don't know what to tell you. Just don't hit this location after midnight I guess. I imagine this wasn't the first time, and won't be the last if they stay employeed here..

It's one thing to close early and go home, but to close early and just sit around at work in the dark?? Pathetic. And laugh at someone who is clearly hangry?! ... smh

To those girls, go apply at a place that closes at 8pm.. 

For the manager to help identify them:
The employees were presumably two females. The one who was able to dodge the photo was young, dark hair, with shorter hair in a pony tail, and shorter than 5'6"", and wearing make up. The one in the photo seemed to have a natural look, and also had dark hair. She seemed taller than the other girl.

I was saddened at how horrific this geriatric hot spot was, and I'm definitely not surprised that this place is now closed. 

Unfortunately I made the decision to try this place out. I have no idea why. 

My friend ordered a sandwich. That's pretty much all there is to say about it. He ordered a sandwich, ate it, and he immediately regretted it. 

I made the poor choice to select the unimpressive and soggy chicken alfredo pasta. It looked as though it had come from a can, a freshly opened can nonetheless, hence the one star. I couldn't eat it without the gag reflex setting in.

"We ordered through the online service Just Eat. The order was for a combination dinner of won ton soup, orange beef, spicy peanut butter chicken, big shrimp with vegetables and spring rolls.

The order showed up exactly at the promised time.

Unfortunately, all of the food was luke warm and had to be reheated in the microwave.

The won ton soup had a plain broth - not very tasteful but the won tons themselves were good.

The spring rolls were excellent and were highlights of the meal.

The orange beef lacked any crispness even before being reheated and was in a dark brown sweet sauce that lacked any orange flavor.

The chicken fried rice was very dry and needed sauce from one or more of the other dishes to be edible.

the big shrimp and vegetables was very good. Decent sized shrimp and stir fried vegetables that were fresh and were flavorful.

The chicken in spicy peanut butter sauce was the mystery dish or the night. I think it was another dish altogether. The thinly sliced chicken was tender but the sauce was orange colored and greasy and there was nothing resembling peanut butter or spice (see photo).

"I must agree with Scott S, but I should point out that I'm probably even less qualified to write a review of this place as I didn't eat here... I merely wandered in and right back out. 

Gone is the crowd and the long wait on a weekend morning waiting for a Pischke's greasy and tasty breakfast. Gone is the kitschy decor that gave the place character. Gone are the sassy waitresses who looked like they needed a good night sleep. Gone are the bursting menus full of good eats at reasonable prices.

Replacing all of this is a bland and boring decor, 50% fewer menu choices, and 50% higher prices. The place was pretty empty while every other breakfast place in the neighborhood (we drove past 5 others) was packed with a line going out the door. Here's a tip for Mr Robert McGrath - if you buy a successful restaurant, don't make drastic changes and jack up the prices... in other words - if it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

I'm actually kinda pissed too because I thought Pischke's was pretty good and it was definitely adding character to our city... what's there now is just another boring restaurant. There's plenty of those around here... Pischke's was unique to the area. When I visit my sister in Minnesota, she has some really neat breakfast places she takes me to that are decorated as an eclectic mess, but that blow you away with good greasy food and are dripping with atmosphere and fun. Same story when I go to San Diego or Long Beach to visit friends. Neat hip cities have neat hip breakfast joints. Well now we have one fewer.

"Edit: Since I reviewed this place, it has become something else and I can no longer recommend it. I'll leave my original 4 star review in tact, but I'm taking away 2 of the stars to reflect the current state of the place - overpriced pretentiousness. I'm taking away one more star because they kept the name and ditched the no-brainer existing and working formula. My review of the new place is elsewhere here on Yelp. 

Here's my original review of the original restaurant - sad to see it gone:

Fantastic breakfasts - a little on the greasy side, but it's a neat little greasy spoon in old town Scottsdale. It belongs in Seattle or Minnesota really. It's certainly a favorable alternative to a breakfast at The Breakfast Club. The staff isn't quite as pretty (but so what?) and the food is a little bit more greasy (but it's oh so good). You don't have to get dressed up to go to breakfast like you do in some of the downtown scottsdale places which is nice. 

It beats going to Denny's and it's reliable for some good food... you can't go wrong here and the crowd is diverse and make for great people-watching. Sometimes it gets really busy, but the wait usually isn't too bad.",1,edit sinc review thi place ha becom someth el longer recommend leav origin star review tact take away star reflect current state place overpr pretenti take away one star becaus kept name ditch exist work formula review new place elsewher yelp origin review origin restaur sad see gone fantast breakfast littl greasi side neat littl greasi spoon old town scottsdal belong seattl minnesota realli certainli favor altern breakfast breakfast club staff quit pretti food littl bit greasi oh good get dress go breakfast like downtown scottsdal place nice beat go denni reliabl good food ca go wrong crowd diver make great sometim get realli busi wait usual bad
"This place was perfect before it was ""upgraded"". It was a simple, kitschy, affordable, little place that had heart. It was a Scottsdale legend... Tragedy struck the family recently. So. Instead of preserving what locals had come to love (obvious if you ever tried to eat here on the weekends), Mr. McGrath instead ""upgraded"" and turned a remarkable place into just another old town restaurant.

Don't me wrong, the Roaring Fork is genius... but this place was as well....",2,thi place wa perfect befor wa upgrad wa simpl kitschi afford littl place heart wa scottsdal legend tragedi struck famili recent instead preserv local come love obviou ever tri eat weekend mcgrath instead upgrad turn remark place anoth old town restaur wrong roar fork geniu thi place wa well
"Apparently Pischke's used to be a fun, personality-filled destination for yummy brunch, which is why my friend Aaron guided us there one early afternoon.

Unfortunately, since Aaron's last visit, changes have been made.

Now Pischke's is a bland eatery with a rather uninspired, limited menu positioned at the aspirational eating price point. As far as I can tell Pischke's target customer is well off older people who are looking for unchallenging options and prices high enough to keep out the riff raff.

Pischke's no longer serves daily brunch, so we had lunch on our visit. Among our group of six, not one of the dishes stood out in a positive way. The burger and salads were average. The crepes were decent but small and nothing special. The pork verde was fine, but inexplicably served with buttered flour tortillas. The pot pie was atrocious-- a ""deconstructed"" take on the typical comfort food it consisted of a large bowl filled with extremely bland pot pie filling, topped by a thin layer of philo dough flakes. It was devoid of everything (taste, crust) that makes a pot pie good.

The food was complimented by very poor service. Our waiter was totally smarmy and condescending, my drink order went unfilled, and when the food was served the waiter had coded the seats wrong so every single meal was placed in front of the wrong person.

Highly unimpressive. While Phoenix may not be known as a fine dining destination, there are plenty of great restaurants in the area to patronize instead. Don't waste your calories, time or money at Pischke's.",1,appar pischk use fun destin yummi brunch whi friend aaron guid u one earli afternoon unfortun sinc aaron last visit chang made pischk bland eateri rather uninspir limit menu posit aspir eat price point far tell pischk target custom well older peopl look unchalleng option price high enough keep riff raff pischk longer serv daili brunch lunch visit among group six one dish stood posit way burger salad averag crepe decent small noth special pork verd wa fine inexplic serv butter flour tortilla pot pie wa atroci deconstruct take typic comfort food consist larg bowl fill extrem bland pot pie fill top thin layer philo dough flake wa devoid everyth tast crust make pot pie good food wa compliment veri poor servic waiter wa total smarmi condescend drink order went unfil food wa serv waiter code seat wrong everi singl meal wa place front wrong person highli unimpress phoenix may known fine dine destin plenti great restaur area patron instead wast calori time money pischk
"Needs a new name - now.  

The Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep ""Pischke's"" alive.  But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke's of old.  Call it ""The Blue Ribbon Cafe"" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.

"I don't understand the reviews of the restaurant.  Either we were on an off day or this restaurant won't last another 30 days.  The food quality, service, management attentiveness was absolutley non-existent.  Some of the dishes could have been good if they were served hot and on time.  Service was horrendously slow and several of the dishes were inedible.  The Sea Bass was extremely salty, the Moroccan Chicken was cold and the medium rare lamb chops were well done.

I guess this use to be a chef driven restaurant, he created a name for the place. But whatever it is now it has definitely fallen off and definitely not good. 

The space is nice enough, I really did not enjoy sitting at the bar and have to look at there dirty kitchen the whole time...But the place does offer a pleasant enough atmosphere. 

The food on the other hand was bad. I had the tasting of the appetizers in which everything was overcooked (mushy eggplant) or overcooked and Burnt (anything that had bread like potential) I kinda of wanted to leave after this but I had ordered my Salmon entree from the start... 

And now on to the entree which consisted of overcooked salmon, burnt spices on the top, and RAW skin underneath, did not make any since to me. it came with a brick of polenta edible only by the pool of sauce on the plate. 

The menu and idea of this restaurant is great, sharp contrasts and bold flavor, but the technique and care is definitely lack here, or maybe they just had a shitty cook that day, I don't know, I just know that I will never make my way back there.",2,yelp ha fail went base review found onli find restaur ha fallen use guess thi use chef driven restaur creat name place whatev ha definit fallen definit good space nice enough realli enjoy sit bar look dirti kitchen whole time place doe offer pleasant enough atmospher food hand wa bad tast appet everyth wa overcook mushi eggplant overcook burnt anyth bread like potenti kinda want leav thi order salmon entre start entre consist overcook salmon burnt spice top raw skin underneath make ani sinc came brick polenta edibl onli pool sauc plate menu idea thi restaur great sharp contrast bold flavor techniqu care definit lack mayb shitti cook day know know never make way back
"Hugely Disappointing!!  Based on all the other reviews maybe they were have an off night?  We already decided not to give it a 2nd try.....

We were seated and given menus but waited a good 10 minutes for them to come back for drink orders.  Then we waited a good 15 minutes for our dirty Kettle One martini's to come and waiting to order.  While we were waiting as patiently as we could the waiter takes the full order (drinks, apps, meal) of the couple who were seated 15 minutes after we arrived! Of course I would be understanding on the wait if the place was packed but there were only 5 tables filled in the entire place!!

We finally ordered and the watier came back 3 different times to clarify what we ordered.

The complimentary bread finally arrived along with our drinks, which by the way were terrible and in filthy (spotty, lipstick stained, crusty).  The bread was really great though so I started to have hope.

From the App's the Scallop and Goat cheese was great- the duck and mushroom was bland.

Main meal of pork chops and sea bass were boring. 

Oh when we got the bill they only did Well Martini's- would that have explained the poor taste or do they just not know how to make?

Bottom Line Summary:

Service Slow
Waiter Confused

"Without a doubt the worst Chinese restaurant in Cleveland . The restaurant is located in an old McDonald's building barely fitted for a sit down restaurant.  

I ordered an egg roll - it was average - mustard and ketchup containers used for hot mustard and sweet and sour - cute. 

I ordered walnut chicken - a ""new"" menu item - it was horrible. I was expecting something fast fried in a brown sauce and stir fried with honey walnuts. What I received was a pile of ""white"" fried chicken with a flavorless sauce and some walnuts thrown in. It tasted like cornstarch -the sauce had absolutely no flavor - I would have added soy sauce, but I don't need the extra sodium and there might not have been enough in the restaurant to spice it up.   

The service was extremely friendly and very attentive - so much so that I couldn't bring myself to complain about the food.  I simply asked for a carryout container, boxed it up, and threw it out at my hotel.  

It was really cheap though - $15.00 for entree and egg roll.  I was on my expense account, so it didn't bother me to go somewhere else to eat that night.  

But do yourself a favor - this place is not good.  Ignore the internet reviews.

"It's amazing how things can go so wrong.

On a 9 a.m. visit, the first thing I noticed was that this shop offers soups, sandwiches, and salads.  I wasn't in the mood for typical breakfast items. I asked the attendant whether they were serving sandwiches.  I even pointed to sandwiches on the menu.  No, he replied, only breakfast items (bacon, sausage, or ham and egg croissants or bagels).

You can't nuke a croissant.  My $4 croissant was no better than a cheap Jimmy Dean frozen sausage croissant from the grocery store. It came with coffee that was nothing special. I pumped the coffee from dispensers that ran dry.  You get better coffee from 7-Eleven.

I noticed servers standing around the soup and salad area.  Out of curiosity, I asked if they were serving soup and sandwiches.  Yes, they serve soup, salad, and sandwiches all day.

I asked the attendant who helped me at first.  ""I thought you said you weren't serving sandwiches.""
   ""Oh no.  We serve them all day!""

What can you do?  I spoke English and apparently he understood it.  What went wrong is anyone's guess.  My first experience here was highly negative.  It's a nice shop, however.  The attendant was friendly and pleasant. Maybe the misunderstanding was somehow all my fault.

Rather than buy anything here, pick up a cheap breakfast sandwich at the nearby Terrible's convenience store. 

Or, take your chances on their soups, sandwiches, and salads. There are pretty pictures all around the shop that make the offerings look tasty.",1,amaz thing go wrong visit first thing notic wa thi shop offer soup sandwich salad wa mood typic breakfast item ask attend whether serv sandwich even point sandwich menu repli onli breakfast item bacon sausag ham egg croissant bagel ca nuke croissant croissant wa better cheap jimmi dean frozen sausag croissant groceri store came coffe wa noth special pump coffe dispens ran dri get better coffe notic server stand around soup salad area curio ask serv soup sandwich ye serv soup salad sandwich day ask attend help first thought said serv sandwich oh serv day spoke english appar understood went wrong anyon guess first experi wa highli neg nice shop howev attend wa friendli pleasant mayb misunderstand wa somehow fault rather buy anyth pick cheap breakfast sandwich nearbi terribl conveni store take chanc soup sandwich salad pretti pictur around shop make offer look tasti

My noodles were cold...like really cold. The portion was beyond stingy- normally with these kind of take-out restaurants I cannot finish my meal, but their were exactly 11 pieces of chicken 7 of which were teeny-tiny bits... The texture of both meat and noodles was very mushy and overall not so tasty. When I paid with debit the girl at the counter literally handed my receipt and said ""sign-this"" ...so much for service.

I stopped by the deli today to grab a sandwich for lunch.  Not many other places in this area to eat so I thought it to be a good choice.  WRONG!!!

"Preface: I live in the Bay Area now, and I don't know many Pittsburgh restaurants beyond Primanti Bros.  Further, I booked a dinner at this ""Kitchen and Wine Bar"" before I knew that my companions were not in a wine mood.  Anyways...

The good news is the service and ambiance were excellent.  All of the servers were friendly and attentive, and the decor was modern yet soothing.  They knew where I could park without feeding a meter and without getting a ticket -- try getting that info on the Embarcadero!

Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the food.  The salmon tartare was very fishy - mostly the salmon ""caviar.""  The saffron rice (sidenote: are you afraid to call it risotto because you're in Aspinwall?   (a) don't be; and (b) then call it very creamy round grained rice, apparently cooked in broth) was so salty that I actually asked myself if I had done something to offend the chef.  He couldn't have meant for it to be this salty, unless he recognizes me from 7th grade study hall or something (and if so, put away the salt shaker and come out of the kitchen --  I haven't forgotten either!)  The short ribs were soft but not as soft as they should be.

Final note: they offered me a free dessert, which was a nice enough touch that I might actually go back, in the hopes that I just caught the chef on an off night.  Hmmm.

"I am not surprised that I am the first to review.
I must also disclose that this will be one the few times that I will write a review based on ONE visit - I normally like to visit at least twice but I would like to live to see another day, and I'm afraid that may not happen if I go there again.

Background: me and few friends had been eyeing this spot for a while; but it gave an eerie feeling and we never ventured. Believing in the power in numbers and in the spirit of adventure, 3 of us went - apparently that was not enough.

The decor? non-existent.
menu? well, most were not available but regular pub food. We got burgers and onion rings and pitcher of beer. I will say that was the crispiest rings ever!made me miss Harvey's onion rings very much. Hamburgers were bland and had a home-made quality, definitely filling. The BLT sandwich was just that: bacon, lettuce, tomato between toasts - nothing else....for $4.

Based on the above, I would have returned except, things got weird. 
The crowd there - sketchy at best (but in that weirdly frightening way- not in the Parkdalian kinda way ), is what would prevent the second visit.

People were watching us, music turned out loudly and someone on his way out to pee(I'm told), stopped behind my friend and gave me a look. A few minutes later, my friends who are born and raised in the small town ways, strongly advised that i finish the beer - and I did as I was told.
As we left, someone half way followed us and another man started screaming - and the staff were nonchalant and indifferent about a mini-fight or the strange group of people just hovering the counter; they weren't going to help us if anything happened.

So.

"Went to Giorgio's for a family reunion type lunch- there were 12 people, and understandably, larger parties take longer to serve....however, Giorgio's took an unbelievably long time for the food to come out to us. Not only did it take long, they brought out meals for 6 us, while the other 6 had to sit and wait another 30 minutes to receive their food. There is no excuse for this. 
Waitresses and staff were nice and polite and were apologetic (they blamed the cooks). However, nothing was compensated for the horrible experience we had there. And it took another 30 minutes to get the check.....who do they have to blame here? 

Food was alright... Descriptions of the menu items not available in English so it was VERY unclear on what the dishes actually contained. Had some unsatisfied family members on meals they expected and what they actually received. Prices very high for what the food. ($16 for a Caesar salad?!)

I should have known when I pulled into the parking lot to get my takeout order. The lot was packed and this place was empty at 8 on a Saturday. The food was absolutely horrible. We got the large Sicilian with pepperoni. The dough was so undercooked it was raw and gummy. There were three little pepperoni slices stacked on top of each other on each large piece leading to almost no pepperoni in every bite. The garlic knots were dry and the tomato dipping sauce was extremely bland. When we called to complain we were told that this is how this is supposed to be. As I left the restaurant I noticed that the lot was packed because of Emporio on the other end of the building. I suggest giving them a shot over Mamma Lucia. Or even go into Market District to get ingredients to make a pie that won't get you sick.,1,known pull park lot get takeout order lot wa pack thi place wa empti saturday food wa absolut horribl got larg sicilian pepperoni dough wa undercook wa raw gummi three littl pepperoni slice stack top larg piec lead almost pepperoni everi bite garlic knot dri tomato dip sauc wa extrem bland call complain told thi thi suppos left restaur notic lot wa pack becaus emporio end build suggest give shot mamma lucia even go market district get ingredi make pie wo get sick

"Actually served this owner at my previous workplace so I thought the experience would be superb but boy was I mistaken!!!!  This 1st time I ordered was about mid May 2014 and the person I spoke with on the phone was highly unprofessional and made me feel like I was doing her a disservice by calling in an order. So I brush it off I mean this is cleveland and good service is almost impossible here.  I order about 50$ worth of food for me and my children and was told the wait time would be 45 minutes so after about 2 hours I call and ask what is delaying our food and again get treated like an inconvenience by yet another employee.  I guess they were so busy they had to have the owner come in and help ( I was under the impression being busy was a good thing) so I spoke to this owner George who I served many times at my previous restsraunt and he assures me that my food will get to me hot and delicious well let's just say when it got to me it was anything but. My wafer fries were cold and disgusting and my cheese sticks were cold as well (yum). Go figure lol. Well before we got off the phone George told me my next order would be discounted.  Fast forward month. My hubby has to be at work at 5 pm so we decide to grab a bite before he goes.  Me and my great ideas want to give Mr hero (ride and denison) another shot because maybe they were just having a bad day? WRONG!!!!! I order 1 roman burger 2 large wafer fries 1 order mozzarella stocks. And she argues with me saying the 9 weer never gives discounts. Twenty five minutes pass after I had already ordered and the grumpy girl says (We ain't got no mozzarella sticks you gone have to order something else) no explanation no apologies just straight up rudeness. So I order buffalo wings hoping the food might just arrive before my hubby has to leave. 45 minutes pass and guess who calls back? yep you guessed it they have no wings either. The ""manager"" I speak to says that she is tired of me ordering complicated items and that if I 2 on accept something ""easier"" that I can just eat somewhere else. Wow I almost list it but I am a mother trying to set the right example so I ask if the owner could kindly call me back. (oh yeah I end up canceling my order ) when he finally calls me he said that 8 his own words "" he cannot find good help in the ghetto"" and that he will not do anything because he simply does not care. I believe him about not caring because it was quite evident in his tone and verbal demeanor.  He also argued with me saying he never offered me any discount .

"When interviewing for a job, they say the interviewer makes a decision in the first 5 seconds. First impressions are likewise important with food, I'm sorry but pastries and cookies sometimes just look good, and sometimes just don't. The presentation of pastries here was underwhelming, nothing ""looked"" good, and the decor was subpar (I'm not a big decor guy, but it does leave an impression).  

Der Brokorb is a small tucked away bakery and sandwich place in Woodchester mall.  A selection of freshly baked breads ($3 per loaf) lines the wall behind the counter which has a small selection of pastries, homemade cookies and desserts.

I stopped by for breakfast, but not a whole lot looked especially appetizing. The only thing that quirked my interest was this chocolate almond cookie thing  ($1.50, see the picture), but it wasn't very tasty. There wasn't another person in the place, so I'm questioning whether turnover is a problem and how fresh the pastries are.


Individual apple pies ($3 each), homemade cookies ($3 per box) looked fairly average.

On the positive side of things, when I walked in through the door I was hit with the smell of freshly baking bread so maybe their breads are pretty good. I wouldn't mind trying a sandwich, but the pastries and cookies didn't leave a good impression.

"I noticed the spelling is off, rather than Queen Creek it is called Qween Creek in the title. However it came up because I searched for Olive Mill. 
When we first got to the place the 'tour' was highly recommended by the person receiving us at the door. 
My poor rating is due to the totally over priced COMMERCIAL which is called a 'tour' and basically has you seated in a small outdoor tent like structure to give you a 5 minute history lesson about the owners who bought the 'farm' in 1998 and a small lesson on how the olives are harvested. Either with a vibrating rake manually or a machine, depending on how closely the trees are planted. The majority of the time is taken up with giving a video demo of the same info the young tour guide rattled off and then giving a commercial about the spa the wife runs and the many uses for olive oil. 
I can give you the tour right here, right now for free. 
Olive oil goes well with chicken and fish and salads. Now repeat this 4 or 5 times and you've got the tour. Also if your olive oils go rancid, feel free to use them for skin care. Funny- I use mine for skincare before it goes rancid. 
The tour DOES NOT INCLUDE a tour of the olive grove. 

    I told 'Emily' who called herself an assistant manager that the place was really nice but the tour was an overpriced commercial and left us feeling disappointed. My daughter who took us out payed $28 for the tour and was left not being able to afford the wine she would have loved to buy. We all agreed that the Tour should have been free to allow us to listen and turn around to walk away when we realized it was just a commercial, which I mute at home when I watch TV. 
The food was yummy, over priced and more of an appetizer portions than a dinner meal. 
In the end the tour was the disappointment that stuck with us and I will Not recommend this place to my relatives who come out to visit in the future. Please if you go out to the Queen Creek Olive Mill, do yourself a favor and skip the tour. It's a waste of your time. Buy a bottle of wine instead.

"Braddock Hills sub shop shut down

May 7, 2016 8:13 AM
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
The Braddock Hills restaurant Rudy's Submarines has been ordered closed following a series of violations, the Allegheny County Health Department announced this morning.

On Thursday, the restaurant's health permit was suspended because it lacked a certified food protection manager, had neither a handwashing sink in the food preparation area nor hot water and soap, and had no date-marking equipment. Counters were not properly cleaned and sanitized, and the floor and ceiling were in poor condition, according to the Health Department.

On Friday, the Yost Boulevard eatery was found to be operating in spite of the closure order. So a second order has been issued, and a red closure placard placed on the front door.",1,braddock hill sub shop shut may pittsburgh braddock hill restaur rudi submarin ha order close follow seri violat allegheni counti health depart announc thi morn thursday restaur health permit wa suspend becaus lack certifi food protect manag neither handwash sink food prepar area hot water soap equip counter properli clean sanit floor ceil poor condit accord health depart friday yost boulevard eateri wa found oper spite closur order second order ha issu red closur placard place front door

I asked a very close relative, whom lived in the Iredell Cabarrus area, she said Lake Todd food is good, off Hwy 3, but She stated she didn't feel comfortable dining in there, she didn't explain why, so myself and husband drove from Charlotte to check it out. I wanted to dine  in, so my food would be fresh and hot, 
When we arrived we wasn't greeted properly, maybe they didn't know any better, but that was our first time at their restaurant.I am A very  bold liberal person, in which,  I feel every race creed and color should be treated equally. I didn't feel that in the atmosphere at all, when myself and husband sat down, of course we had to find our own seats, in which is ok, but it seem like everyone in there, even the youths act if they had seen someone from out of space. Very unfriendly atmosphere, to the point we had to get up and leave, without ordering. I am from this area grew up and was raise in this area and lived in this area until I got Married, I have a lot to say, but this isn't the platform to voice it on, but if you don't want to welcome or eat with any other race other than the white race, you should have a sign that says for whites only. I grew up when it was signs like that in Iredell, Cabarrus, Catawba, Rowan, Lincolnton, and Union counties, there are plenty others, but these are the counties where I visit or lived at.  As A young lady I fought hard behind the scenes to make it a better place to lived and work in that area for all race,  til the point my father stated I had  to leave town , because they had Labeled as a Black Militant, and it wasn't safe for me to live there , being a  young country girl , I asked him what did that meant,  and he explained it to me. I couldn't tell no one what he shared with me , so at 17 years of age I moved to Charlotte to live with an Aunt until he told me it was ok to come back. When I went to that Fish Camp it took me back to the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s . I can't apologize for this review ,  I am not telling anyone not to go there, but this is what happen to myself and my husband...and if it has happen to anyone else, speak up,,,,,Think about it!!!
No I will not recommend or go back there to eat, And I have white and black African Americans friends...",1,want good fish last friday ask veri close rel live iredel cabarru area said lake todd food good hwi state feel comfort dine explain whi husband drove charlott check want dine food would fresh hot arriv wa greet properli mayb know ani better wa first time veri bold liber person feel everi race creed color treat equal feel atmospher husband sat cours find seat ok seem like everyon even youth act seen someon space veri unfriendli atmospher point get leav without order thi area grew wa rais thi area live thi area got marri lot say thi platform voic want welcom eat ani race white race sign say white onli grew wa sign like iredel cabarru catawba rowan lincolnton union counti plenti counti visit live young ladi fought hard behind scene make better place live work area race til point father state leav town becaus label black milit wa safe live young countri girl ask meant explain could tell one share year age move charlott live aunt told wa ok come back went fish camp took back ca apolog thi review tell anyon go thi happen husband ha happen anyon el speak think recommend go back eat white black african american friend

"Our group was very dissappointed with the pizza.  The margarita pizza was loaded with garlic which was overpowering - ended up throwing out half of the pizza. However, The Trailblazer, sausage, roasted onions and peppers and portabella mushrooms was good.  The wine was not very good we actually sent it  back becuase it was old.

"Reusing mason jars is cool, reusing French fries is not! The fries for our steak came in two colours, fresh fried ones and another darker colour. The darker one after looking at it carefully, the very salty taste of the fries, and the crumple look of the darker fries we concluded it was deep fried already before. Maybe leftovers from previous diner? 

The way too salty taste of the fries spread to the steak as well. It was barely edible, which was a shame because it was a perfect medium rare.

We also order the 1 lb chicken wings because according to other reviews say it was fall off the bone goodness. We got it grilled because it was healthier. This too was also disappointing. These were the most tasteless wings I have ever put in my mouth. My girlfriend had to take it home and put some soya sauce on it. Yes very Asian.

The overall ambiance was nice with the reclaim wood wall and the glass doors. The waitress was new and was friendly. She was confused when I replied that the steak and fries were too salty. But if I just wanted nice ambiance and good service I would have went to the museum!

"My friends and I went to Sandey's Broaster Chicken on 1155 S Higley in Mesa, AZ. As loyal customers we are highly disappointed in the change. They have added an Indian Buffet to the restaurant. The macaroni and cheese was not cheesy but tasted like flour and was soupy. The cole slaw had an after taste to it like it had not been properly covered in the refrigerator at night and absorbed the odor of other foods.
