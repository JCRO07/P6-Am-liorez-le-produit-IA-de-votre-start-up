       "'[\\'I decided to try Marvellous Edibles because of the rave review the first reviewer gave it, and because it is in my neighborhood of Leaside. I\\\\\\'ve always driven past it and wondered what it was like, but since she gave it such a great review, I thought I\\\\\\'d give it a go. \\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant has a sort of Parisian cafe feel to it, with mismatched chairs and some booths and tables, and a mural on the wall. Upon arrival mid-Saturday afternoon, we were also presented with 3 menus, breakfast (which was ending shortly), sandwiches and another menu which appeared to be dinner options, priced $16 - $24 range. My friend and I both selected from the sandwich menu. \\\\n\\\\nI ordered the BLT, but having noticed that they served peameal bacon for breakfast, asked if I could have peameal on my BLT, they obliged, no problem. My friend ordered the meat loaf sandwich and we both ordered the sweet potato fries. \\\\n\\\\nService was fast, there were only 2 other occupied tables in the restaurant. I was expecting an average sandwich, didn\\\\\\'t really figure you can screw up a BLT, er...thought wrong. The peameal was overcooked, and very dry, and it was served on \\\\\\'white\\\\\\' bread, no egg or challah bread to be found here!! I was disappointed. The whole sandwich was dry, I asked for mayo, and the waiter said there was already mayo on it, I opened it up and the thing was bare. I showed him, and said, \"Umm, actually there\\\\\\'s not...\" (awkward...) \\\\n\\\\nMy friend\\\\\\'s meatloaf sandwich was a mess!! First she had asked for no onions, was allergic to them, and upon receiving the sandwich, had to proceed to pick off somewhere in the range of 7-8 pieces of red onion off of her sandwich!! The problem with the sandwich was just that it was a complete mess. It was on a regular bun, and gravy was poured over the meatloaf and the other half of the bun was placed on top. On service, the bottom part of the bun, is soaked, drenched in gravy, making it impossible to pick up! It was just a mess, I think it would be a much more successful item choice if perhaps it was served as an open faced meat loaf sandwich, with the gravy in a boat on the side that you pour on yourself at the time you are going to eat it, so that the bottom bun doesn\\\\\\'t disintegrate. \\\\n\\\\nAs if our food quality wasn\\\\\\'t bad enough while we were attempting to salvage a meal out of it, our entertainment was listening to our waiter bicker with the other waitress about table assignment and allocation of tips and how unfair she had been. The disagreement got quite heated and their voices were raised, creating quite a bit of tension in the restaurant amongst the customers, or at least, that was my perception. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, I was not impressed with the food or the service of this restaurant. I would not recommend it. I will not be returning to try their breakfast or brunch, or even to give it a second chance. Unfortunately, that was my very first and last visit. You know what they say, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.\\'\\n \"Came back into town after I moved out of state for a few years. We ordered the normal chicken salad with house dressing and chicken wings seasoned and to be honest. It was nothing like it used to be. The fries were dried out. Dressing was all paste. And the chicken wings didn\\'t seem completely done. It\\'s a shame bc I used to love this place. It def turned my taste buds to go elsewhere though. Hopefully it changes next time I visit!\"\\n \"Stopped in to order a White pizza after shopping. Do I did not order ahead. First time there, wasn\\'t a menu posted to see what options were... Ordered the White pizza almost 30 minute wait and was unimpressed with the pizza. Thin and no flavor.\"\\n \\'This is a great place for drinks and bar food if you don\\\\\\'t mind the stench of cigarette smoke. Don\\\\\\'t expect to escape the foul smell by sitting in the \"non-smoking\" dining area, separated by doors used by bar patrons to use the bathroom. \\\\nI\\\\\\'ll never know why any business owner would cater to the filthy, unhealthy habits of a few and risk losing the business of 76% of the population that do not smoke.\\'\\n \\'Bad customer service and rude employees. Unfriendly atmosphere. The young girl serving me looked disgusted to work there and was purely throwing the food on the plate! Not going back\\'\\n \"Where do I start, with the fact that this Mexican restaurant is owned by non mexicans or that the flavorless food is probably what they know as Mexican I don\\'t know but I and everybody in my family were disapointed to say the least I ordered steak fajitas which is a Tex Mex dish FYI and it was horrible this are supposed to be grilled but not here they were boiled and this is a big no. The burrito my friend ordered was awful also so was the service with a waitress that try to speak Spanish to us with no luck at all which was weird because she had a Portuguese accent and both languages are alike anyways my advice go to Don Tequilas us just a couple blocks down.\"\\n \"Absolument inadmissible qu il n\\'y ait pas la possibilité de payer avec une carte de débit ou de crédit à cet établissement....Réveillez-vous ! On est en 2019 ! Aujourd\\'hui, la plupart des transactions se font en ligne. À moins que ça fasse bien votre affaire d\\'être payé en argent comptant...\"\\n \\'Consider this place a mid flight refueling station between the downtown nightclubs and a night in jail somewhere in the Heights lol\\\\n\\\\nDefinitely not a place for the faint hearted. I usually frequent the place late hours(2:00am-4:00am crazy huh?). The food is typical greasy spoon but good. The gyros are really good too. They buzz you to the restrooms through a locked door at the top of the stairs(apparently to control the vagrant piss population). They are conveniently located in an abyss of a catacomb basement piss trough(it may be better to wet your pants and stay alive than to chance it...) \\\\n\\\\nOH! ....and be sure to tip the local hustlers waiting outside. Cheap insurance and a distraction for a clean get away!\\'\\n \\'I waited a hour and 30 min. They game my food away to females that walked in 20 min after me and placed a order. Food was not what it was the first time I went\\'\\n \\'This was my go to spot but tonight I got cold food and when I told them that it was they argued me down and ask what I wanted to do I said I would prefer some hot food told the guy my fries was cold on my polish boys he took the fries off and made some fresh ones and put them on a cold polish boy with soggy bread I took them and said I will never visit this establishment again but I will say the woman who works in the morning is awesome she always prepares hot food sorry she had to lose a loyal customer.\\'\\n \"I went into the restaurant like normal a few weeks back and I saw a girl go in the back and the light skinned cook with freckles disappeared no one noticed me I went to the window and his pants was down to his ankles and she was standing in front of him he was playing with himself and I said hey what the fuck is going on they both jumped and apologize to me but what took the cake he went to take some food off the grill without washing his hands I\\'m so disgusted I\\'ll never eat there again\"\\n \"When we arrived it took our waitress considerable time to bring us 2 diet cokes let alone even take our order. She kept walking by us and saying that she would be right with us, however it took her 20 minutes of backing and forthing to actually get to us and the restaurant wasn\\'t even that busy later on a sunday evening. We decided to order calamari with tomato sauce. It was brought out in 35 minutes without tomato sauce. After asking for the tomato sauce, it took another 10 minutes to get it. But I have to say the calamari was probably the only decent thing about this night. We got our food shortly after. I ordered the goat cheese ravioli with smoked salmon. I\\'m 99% sure that there was little to no goat cheese in my ravioli as it had the taste and texture of ricotta cheese...something you\\'d pick up frozen at the grocery store. I also had to search for any pieces of smoked salmon as they were miniscule and few and far between. Overall, I\\'ve had store bought pasta much better than that. My boyfriend ordered the New York striploin which was supposed to come with tempura onion rings...there were none to be seen. The cut of the steak was completely wrong and the whole middle of the steak was all gristle. He also asked for sauce on the side and his steak was completely coated in it. It was disgusting and I actually felt bad watching him eat it and try to cut the thing. We then sat for 20 minutes waiting for the waitress to clear our plates and give us our bill. She would walk by us continuously and ignore us. We had a coupon for the restaurant which is another reason why we decided to try it, and both waitresses tried to short change us on the value of it, finally after telling them 3 times what needed to be done, they got it right.The service here was atrocious, the food was seriously lacking, especially for the price, the atmosphere was alright however it was freezing because it was cold and drafty.I\\'d never waste my time going here again and would warn other people about going there. I have no idea how this restaurant is still surviving in today\\'s marketplace.\"\\n \"This was easily the worst dining experience I have ever had.\\\\nI reserved for four people on the Saturday before Mother\\'s day at 7pm. When we arrived we were placed in the bar, with music so loud it made conversation virtually impossible. I asked the hostess about seating in the restaurant as I had reserved and she said it was full. She offered to move us to another table in the bar, ut it was closer to the live music and would have been even noisier.\\\\nWe ordered some drinks and I was confronted with a bottle of beer, with no glass. There was nothing fine dining about the atmosphere or he service. It was a bar room experience at fine dining prices.\\\\nThe food was the only thing left to rescue the evening and it was a disaster. I ordered the pork tenderloin which was so overcooked that I thought they has served a pork chop with the bone in. It was also flavorless and burnt. My dining companions also expressed great disappointment with their meals, using terms like flavorless, over-cooked and cold.\\\\nWe quickly paid the bill and left to seek a more appropriate venue for dessert and coffee. By this time even Tim Horton\\'s seemed appealing.\\\\nAvoid this restaurant. The only thing that is fine dining is the pricing.\"\\n \\'I was definitely seeing a lot of red at the Red Martini!  I usually have a 3 strikes and you\\\\\\'re out policy... If this were a baseball game, the Red Martini\\\\\\'s winning streak would be in the negatives!\\\\n\\\\nIt was my high school English teacher\\\\\\'s birthday and because she lives I\\\\\\'m the Durham Region we usually dine somewhere in Pickering or Ajax. It gets me out of Toronto once in awhile.  So I had made reservations for 7pm. When we arrived there were 2 occupied tables in the downstairs bar lounge.  We stood there for 5 minutes with no sign of any hostess or staff.  After what seemed like an eternal wait, the waitress appeared and she told us we could choose a table either upstairs or downstairs.  We opted for the upper level.\\\\n\\\\nThe Red Martini is a house-converted restaurant, similar to 22 Church Street Bistro across the street.  A co-worker told me that the 2 restaurant are owned by the same owner, however this is unconfirmed.  However I did spot a lot of similarities.\\\\n\\\\nOnce we chose our table, again we were left unattended and ignored for awhile. We quickly realized that the waitress who \"greeted\" us downstairs was the only staff in the front end for the entire restaurant. Strike 1 - understaffed.\\\\n\\\\nMy high school English teacher loves her white wine and she usually orders the house white.  Strike 2 - they were out of their house white.  This is a clear indication of poor restaurant management.  So we had no other choice than to order the next available white wine which was twice the cost.\\\\n\\\\nWe waited for our appetizer - no bread basket appeared - Strike 3 and you\\\\\\'re out! \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered and shared the Stuffed Portobello Mushroom Salad to start. This could\\\\\\'ve easily been THE best tasting salad I\\\\\\'ve ever had in my life. However, the minor neglect in detail made it second best.  The salad was a deconstructed-style salad. The grilled portobello mushrooms were delicious. The \"stuffing\" was made from imitation crab meat and eggs... So essentially it tasted like an egg salad.  It was also served with COLD naan bread... It would\\\\\\'ve been the perfect salad if they grilled the naan. We had requested that the appetizer come first and then our mains... However the server showed up 2 minutes into us digging into our salads, so we had to send her back to the kitchen and requested the food be kept warm.\\\\n\\\\nMy Coconut Tilapia was served with a spicy plum sauce, Bok Choy, red and yellow bell peppers and jasmine rice. When I first bit into the tilapia I was excited that the fish skin was so crisp... But I quickly realized that the crisp was not due to skillful culinary execution, but rather to a burnt fish... Parts of it were so burnt I started tasting charcoal!  Also, the \"coconut\" component of the dish was M.I.A.  This dish had so much potential.. *sigh*\\\\n\\\\nI didn\\\\\\'t try my teacher\\\\\\'s Veggie Stir-Fry with Chicken but the feedback I got from her wad that the vegetables were cooked to a mush, and that the chicken was dry.  In their defense, the mush factor may have been a result of the dish being kept on a warming plate.\\\\n\\\\nTo finish we ordered a cappuccino, tea and marbled cheesecake.  The server came back up to inform me that they don\\\\\\'t offer cappuccino... How do you not know that?  Its like she was a temp hired to tide over a quiet Sunday restaurant service.  So I settled for a coffee.  \\\\n\\\\nThe cheesecake was average, nothing spectacular.  \\\\n\\\\nAt the end of the day, the bill came to $105.  I will say that the portion sizes are generous and the food does have potential... However, the service aspect is going to need a complete facelift.  I had such high hopes for you Red Martini... I thought you\\\\\\'d be sizzling... But unfortunately the only thing that was red and sizzling about my experience at the Red Martini was my dress and the afterburn in my mouth from the spicy plum sauce!\\'\\n \"Restaurants and bars in the Flats seem to have trouble delivering good service.  We sat at the bar and ordered 2 beers.  The bartender asked if he wanted to open a tab.  Well, we sat there with empty glasses and she never asked us if we wanted to order more beer.  If I was the owner I\\'d kick her ass for not generating more revenue.  This is the second time I\\'ve had this happen to me at this place.  It was crowded on a Wednesday night but the buck stopped there...\"\\n \\'Si Senor is not my favorite taco option. I got a steak taco and the bit of steak was so little my meat was about the size of a quarter. I could hardly believe how little meat I had.   I ate here because in the summer they have an outside food stand at the USX tower.  I remember being out of the taco that wanted.  So whenever a food venture is out of something that I want that immediately knocks off some starts for me.  The salsa options were great but I dare say Qdoba is better then this place.\\'\\n \"The tacos were cold and the dude was sketchy.  I probably could have told this just by looking but I had gotten lost on my way to ginger\\'s and was hungry.\\\\n\\\\nAt least it was cheap.\"\\n \\'Ick.  I don\\\\\\'t think this classifies as Mexican.  I was mislead by the name but should have known better once I saw they offer wraps.  I figured they used the name wraps in place of burritos since... well... Pittsburgh is really unfamiliar with Mexican food.\\\\n\\\\nI ordered the classic wrap which, according to the description, is your choice of protein, beans, cheese, rice, and choice of sauce stuffed in a tortilla.  I went with the shredded beef and chipotle sauce.  What I got ... well I can see why they referred to it as a wrap and not a burrito.  The tortilla was cold (what?) and the \"shredded beef\" was more like beef chunks.  The iceberg lettuce was an unwelcome surprise.  Black beans.... I hate black beans.  I guess it was wrong to assume they would be pinto or refried.  The chipotle sauce wasn\\\\\\'t spicy at all and just added a burnt flavor.\\\\n\\\\nWould never come back.  I can\\\\\\'t believe I paid $7.20 for this wrap.  \\\\n\\\\nIf for some odd reason you want to try this place.... they do offer vegan / vegetarian options with grilled veggies and tofu as an option for your filling.\\\\n\\\\nP.S. California, I miss you.\\'\\n \\'I tried the Gilbert location of this restaurant. I believe it recently opened there on Gilbert Rd, in between Warner Rd & Elliot Rd. It was a cute location, and the atmosphere inside was quaint. \\\\nHowever, the lighting was much too bright for a restaurant, and the kitchen sounds could be heard throughout the restaurant. \\\\nOverall, my experience was horrible. My food was cold, even though it took 5 minutes longer for my food to come out than the my 3 friends\\\\\\' plates. The coffee was sub par, which made a horrible first impression on me. The price seemed a little much - however, I did not take advantage of the \"pastry bar\", because nothing looked too appetizing. French toast, which I thought was pretty foolproof, did not taste good. And the bacon was covered in maple syrup and some sort of brown sugar. \\\\nI didn\\\\\\'t feel too alone; no one in my party had rave reviews for their meals. There were 4 of us altogether, and our food barely fit on the table, which was inconvenient and very annoying. \\\\n\\\\nIf I could give 0 stars, I would. I would say do not waste your time here! There are many enjoyable breakfast establishments around; this just happens not to be one of them.\\'\\n \"I live a block away from where the Spaghetti Shop WAS, and I can promise that this restaurant no longer exists.  It\\'s been torn down, and a Burger King is going up in its place.  I hope that Yelp deletes this restaurant from its listing or recognizes that it is no longer an establishment.  If you\\'re interested in Italian food in C-U, try Biaggi\\'s or Bacaro\\'s or Cafe Luna.\"\\n \\'I used to like Reggies, and was a regular customer, but have found the quality to really become erratic recently, which is a shame.  On it\\\\\\'s good days, the best items to try are their comfort foods and breakfasts (all day).  \\\\n\\\\nFirst, when pulling in, beware, as the parking lot is VERY rough, with MAJOR pot holes.  For your car\\\\\\'s sake, GO SLOW!\\\\n\\\\nOne item that I\\\\\\'ve liked here is the \"old fashioned,\" which is a couple potato pancakes (served with sour cream and cheese), couple eggs, breakfast meat, and toast.   Another few that I\\\\\\'ve liked are their ruben, their Philly Cheese steak, their ciabatta club sandwich, the hot roast beef sandwich (served open face) and their chicken enchilada soup (spicy).  Also, on the weekends, in the morning, they have a \"breakfast bar\", a buffet of typical breakfast items, including eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, pancakes, waffles, corned beef hash and an assortment of fruit.\\\\n\\\\nTheir NY Strip steaks seem to be very hit or miss.  I\\\\\\'ve gotten some excellent steaks, cooked quite well before, but have also gotten a number that felt like half gristle.  It felt like about a 30% chance of getting a bad steak.\\\\n\\\\nTalking more of the erratic quality, an example, one time when I ordered the ciabatta turkey club, I got a sandwich with soggy ciabatta bread and RAW bacon (not just undercooked, it looked like it hadn\\\\\\'t been cooked AT ALL!).  I\\\\\\'ve also gotten eggs burned at random times, bacon burned, hashbrowns burned, etc.  Again, this is not a 100% thing, but it is enough recently to make it not worth my while coming back anytime soon unfortunately.\\'\\n \\'This place is no longer in business. It has been closed for at least 4 months. At first sign said closed for remodel been has since been taken down.\\'\\n \\'Like one of the other reviewers I had found Reggies adequate but not recommendable from past very irregular visits, (the last has to have been a year or more ago). but we happened there on a Saturday 11 A.M.ish, and were seated promptly by the sixteen year old who was our host.  \\\\nHe asked what beverages we would like and forgot one and had to get a \"refresh\" in order to fulfill, and then we waited for a waitress. \\\\nWe were told our waitress\\\\\\'s name by our host and as always unless it\\\\\\'s one of those un-names that just blows your socks off, like Kashikeewandamoo, it went in one ear and out the other. \\\\nUnfortunate, because we NEVER got the opportunity to make her acquaintance. \\\\nWe waited and waited. And after a bit, decided the breakfast buffet would beat the alternative of nothing, so up we went.  Never realizing how wrong we were!\\\\nI have become over the years a less than enthusiastic buffet attendee. \\\\nThey tend to be harbingers of germs, old tired food, and some sadist is always trying to set up food far enough on the far side of the sneeze shield so as to require modified limbo dancing or monkey-arms that drag on the floor in order to get what one wants!  \\\\nSo what did we have?\\\\nAbsolutely the worst scrambled eggs ever!  So dry and crumbly they virtually refused to be manuvered by a fork as the sand-sized particles lacked the moisture to bind together.  It was like trying to eat flour!  \\\\nNo waitress from whom to beg ketchup or hot sauce or beverage refills.\\\\nEggs are delicate, don\\\\\\'t cook a couple gallons at a throw so you never have to replenish,  cook small batches so the steam table doesn\\\\\\'t dehydrate them over time,!  Also whenever possible  try to use real god^amn eggs and not the re-hydrated powdered used-to-be-eggs. \\\\nThe country potatoes or whatever they were supposed to be were equally dry, as well as burnt, and did I mention dry?  And man were they dry.  \\\\nI ended up putting sausage gravy on them hoping to find something to choke them down with and even that didn\\\\\\'t work!  \\\\nThe bacon was fine, but one does feel just a little silly filling a plate with bacon in order to flesh out one\\\\\\'s plate!  \\\\nThe owner is a very nice guy, (thin as a rail...I can see where eating here exclusively would be a weight-watcher\\\\\\'s dream!) and when he walked by I told him we hadn\\\\\\'t seen a waitress (we were finished dining at this point), and he said he would take care of us, refreshed our drinks and took them off the bill, so kudos to him for an attempt at a fix, but I would have been much happier had they just set off a bomb at the buffet station to blow it elsewhere, in deference to the well-being of the next hapless diner!  If you come order off the menu!!  Unless you are a real bacon FREAK!\\'\\n \\'Besides being dirty, rundown and plain grungy.  The food was gross.  We had the Brunch Buffet on Sunday afternoon.  \\\\n\\\\nEverything was cold, stale and not worth eating.  The OJ was good.\\'\\n \"Went in there recently to grab a coffee and my colleague grabbed breakfast. Her food was cheap and looked awesome. I was really excited to try it myself. I came back the next morning with my wife and child. This was a Sunday morning at 8AM. The sign on the door said they were open from 7AM-11AM on Sundays. I was terribly disappointed, and my rating will stay low until I get a chance to go back and try again. Maybe they won\\'t be closed on one of the biggest breakfast mornings of the week (especially when the sign in the window said they would be open!)\"\\n \"I have been to a couple different City Tavern locatations and had the exact same experience. The food is not good at all, and is completely over priced. I\\'ve had their crab leg special and crab cakes and wasn\\'t impressed at all. I would only return to get drinks, and because the City Tavern by where I live has great outdoor seating.\"\\n \"Firefly is yet another Food Fight Inc establishment in Madison, this one catering to the Asian fusion set.  Like all Food Fight Inc. places, the decor seems to have been given a larger budget than the menu.  Anything you can find on the menu here (curries, pad thai, etc..), you can find a better version of at any of Madison\\'s other Thai places.  Skip it and head to Sai Bai Thong down the street.\"\\n \"THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE GOOD FOOD FROM 2005????\\\\n\\\\nThis used to be high atop of my list. But several cooks, and two years later, their food has gone completely downhill. Don\\'t worry though, this place is on University Ave between Madison and Middleton, and since most people eating in Madison won\\'t drive too far, there is no worry of accidentally walking into this place. If you do, turn around and RUN out. \\\\n\\\\nLettuce wraps used to be with butter lettuce, now iceberg?\\\\nCurried Beef Short Ribs used to be incredible, now the recipe is completed different, and sorry, but not very good.\\\\n\\\\nYou would be better off fasting than eating here.\"\\n \\'The only reason why I can imagine one going here is one member of your party wants sushi, the other wants some kind of Americanized wrap and chips, and yet another wants curry?  You could get all of those things separately and better tasting  elsewhere, but if you need them in once place, I guess you should go to Firefly.\\'\\n \\'Ok, there\\\\\\'s something to be said about a restaurant that is two blocks away from your house.  Especially if they DO have yummy and fruity Mai Tais, and Lemongrass Martini that\\\\\\'s LOADED with alcohol.  On Friday afternoons, it\\\\\\'s rather a cool hangout, and great ambiance. \\\\n\\\\nTheir food, however, sucks.  It\\\\\\'s supposed to be Asian fusion, and while I am still enjoying any \"fusion\" type place (aka, a hint of ethnic, a ton of Americanization), this is rather mediocre food at best, completely vegetarian unfriendly (which is odd, given the fact that this is Madison).\\\\n\\\\nService is good though, the staff is kind and attentive.\\\\n\\\\nBut I\\\\\\'d only go there for drinks.

The bowl was very hot but the center of the dip was still refrigerator cold...... I informed the server and she said she would be back with another.  15 minutes later she arrived with ANOTHER cold dip. I changed my order and waited.... after another 45 minutes without our entree we asked for a manager. After 10 minutes no manager showed up and we left without our food.

NEVER GO HERE\\'\\n \"Worst service ever. Don\\'t know the menu and takes forever. Go to Popeyes down the road.\"\\n \\'Let me sum it up: Food is horrible, mac and cheese was runny, poor service , got a medium mac and cheese I opened it it was basically a small.\\'\\n \"Last Friday I called in my order so I didn\\'t have to wait so long, always follow your first mind! Something told me to go somewhere else! me being lazy, went there because it\\'s close to home, 25 min later after putting in my order I went to pick it up, as I was standing in line I noticed something running down the pole by the deep fryer, it was the biggest rat that I\\'ve ever seen!!! I screamed and ran out of there as fast as I could.... They don\\'t ever have to worry about me again! And it came out in front of everyone! I\\'m still shook up! Smh\"\\n \\'All I can say is never again! I spent $8.50 on the most nastiest perch dinner.  The fish was non existent and on some white bread.  Cold,  stale disgusting fries. Never again!\\'\\n \\'The food is horrible I was in at 8 pm Saturday 4/30/16 I standing there waiting on my order big rat run under the ice machine  the lazy owner laugh it off this place is nasty never again it was many people in there as usual but you can do better somewhere else owner has a smart mouth and charge for everything he has to offer\\'\\n \\'They are known for the empanadas, and when I had the chance to enjoy a jalapeno and beef one, I can understand.  \\\\n\\\\nI also ordered an humita, and it was nothing compared to the Ecuadoran place..\\'\\n \\'So far so good. I am not a big wing fan but it is on my way and a new place to try (open two months). \\\\n\\\\nI ordered the spicy boneless wings. They were crispy, hot, meaty, with no skin and little fat. That was OK with me. \\\\n\\\\nThe celling is tall and the south wall is all glass letting the winter sun in. This gave the place a wide open, airy, \"Texas ice house kind of feel\" (1PM) Which was OK with me because it was a beautiful day, but a little too chilly to sit outside on the patio in shorts. \\\\n\\\\nNice tap beer selection especially for Chandler. I had a pint of Sierra Nevada\\\\\\'s Celebration Ale. Tasted OK to me. \\\\n\\\\nThe bartender was friendly and attentive. I asked her about the tap selection and she had a working knowledge of craft beer. Eventually it came out that she was a beer fan and had a kegerator in her garage (things are getting interesting...). Service was OK with me. \\\\n\\\\nI like this place so far and will go back to try a different beer and menu item. \\\\n\\\\nUpdate: Dropped from 3 to 2 stars. 2nd visit tried two different appetizers. Neither were good, I\\\\\\'ve seriously had better food out of a frozen TV dinner. Bummer! The trip was salvaged by Guinness on tap and a friendly barmaid.\\'\\n \\'Terrible ... bad wings, bad rings, soulless atmosphere..\\\\nWhat a shame\\'\\n \"Here\\'s my order on Feb 25 2017.\\\\nSmoked meat plate, cheeseburger,2 steamies.\\\\nThere has been some comments regarding owner/employee ethnicities...WHO CARES?\\\\nThese guys just don\\'t know what they\\'re doing.\\\\nFirst thing they did was put my fries and hotdogs on my tray, then put the patty on the grill for the cheeseburger. WRONG! By the time the burger and smoked meat were done, everything else was cold!\\\\nStart the burger FIRST, then start on the sandwich, then the dogs.\\\\nFries are the LAST to go on the tray.\\\\nThis advice comes from a Greek who used to work in the business.\\\\nBTW, smoked meat rubbery, rye bread stale,meat to bun ratio for cheeseburger WAY off, either more meat or less bun, figure it out, fries were dry, hot dogs...meh.\\\\nNever going back, place is a dump.\"\\n \"I recently tried this place again after living beside it for the past 17 years ... it used to be to 50 cent hotdogs and it\\'s always been a dump.... sad to read reviews and hear that they are still coughing on people\\'s food and their hands ... this place has always been disgusting and I feel the need to warn people . Belle province is great but the belle province in this locating is crap... by the way their poutine is like soup\"\\n \\'Recently changed owners again. No longer the Asian owner. I visited 2 weeks ago for a fairly large order. The owner was at the cash and open-mouthed coughed into the register and on his hands. He then proceeded to help the cook fill the order without gloves and without washing his dirty hands. The cook had dropped a wax paper hotdog wrap on the floor, the owner picked it up and returned it to the counter and sure enough, the cook used it. Gross! If you complain - you get \"the special\" - better to just warn others and never return.\\'\\n \\'Everything TASTED fine when it came to flavor in itself, just isn\\\\\\'t put together properly like it use to. I want to say that maybe it\\\\\\'s just a new kid getting the hang of it, but like any restaurant, it\\\\\\'s still team work and they should be watching eachothers backs.\\\\n\\\\nOrdered with Uber Eats and it came A LOT faster than the displayed time :) I guess because I live less than 5 min away? lol\\\\n\\\\nAbout 28$ total for the food before any taxes or fees. I ordered 3 items.\\\\n\\\\nNo utensils or condements, or noticed they\\\\\\'re uber menu asking me if i needed any. Good thing I was at home and not at work or something. I don\\\\\\'t recommend this food for delivery as it would probably hold it\\\\\\'s quality better if eaten right away in the restaurant, because apparently 5 minutes is too long for this food since they don\\\\\\'t wrap it up in proper delivery packages.\\\\n\\\\nOne Grilled Cheese sandwich $4.25 : This was literally just a grilled cheese sandwich I could have gotten anywhere for 2$. Regular 2 slices of white toast and kraft single cheese in the middle, and \"pan-fried?\". Would had been nice to have pan fried it in beef juice since they do make burgers there. If they want to go the classic simple route to a grilled cheese while charging this much, then they should have changed the bread and cheese to bring more value to the price, also offer extra charges for side orders like pickles, salted tomatoes, or coleslaw and make it into a meal instead of just the sandwhich, of which I won\\\\\\'t be ordering again if it stays the same. Because it was wrapped in wax paper, the heat excaped, cooling it down to the point where the cheese nearly solidifies and no longer stretches :(\\\\n\\\\nOne Smoke Meat sandwich $8.95 : This is actually pretty expensive for a smoked meat sandwich. The tiny bread was funny compared to the mountain of smoked meat, but I could live with that. What concerned me was the pale color of the meat. Tasted fine at least, nice moist and flavorful, but it came with nothing else for it\\\\\\'s price?! Wierd, not even pickles or something... It was still more on the cold side eventhough they did wrap it up with metalic paper, so I don\\\\\\'t know what is going on there.\\\\n\\\\nMedium Sized Sausage Poutine $10.45 + extra cheese $4 : They apparently think HOT DOG WEINERS are sausages?! No way, that has to be a mislead because they have \"HOT DOGS\" written in the rest of their menu. They need to edit that because I was really disapointed, eventhough they gave me a mountain of these sliced weiners. As I was digging in, I have to say I laughed when I realized that I was having a hard time finding the fries lol I literally had more cheese than fries LOL I shouldn\\\\\\'t have ordered the extra cheese because they honor it way more than any other food place I\\\\\\'ve ever seen, it was almost cute lol. It also wasn\\\\\\'t hot enough, so the cheese curds didn\\\\\\'t semi-melt. The gravy sauce tasted nice, though the quantity was lacking, and the fries were on the light side and soft, when LBP use to make them a lot darker. They put it in a styrofoam packaged which sucks compared to their older aluminum pie packages, so not only did it leak, but most of it\\\\\\'s heat was lost in the 5 min travel time, which is really fast, and like I said, the way they package their food is not meant to be delivered, it\\\\\\'s meant to be eaten there at their location, and I don\\\\\\'t think they realise that.\\\\n\\\\nReading some of these reviews only now... I think the changes I noticed is all these peoples fault lol #1 You\\\\\\'re supposed to wait a good 5 min before eating poutine ! That HEAT is the finishing touch of the cooking!\\\\n\\\\nTo the Restaurant Owner: I know how hard it can be to please everyone. Change one thing, and the ones who previously liked it will complain lol What I wish more restaurants/fast food places would do is offer more detailed choices on orders, that way you can\\\\\\'t really go wrong. It\\\\\\'s not enough to just have a \"note\" customers can write to the restaurant for each order, because I can imagine some changes will effect the price and I don\\\\\\'t want a restaurant to feel their budget is breaking. I do like how close this place is, so I will try it again in a year to see if any changes were put in.\\'\\n \\'I have never been so disappointed with chick fil a. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with extra pickles and Colby cheese and waffle fries. I got a spicy chicken sandwich with ONE pickle, pepper jack cheese and no waffle fries. Not a pleasant visit at all.\\'\\n \"Boy oh boy... Where to start...This use to be my usual every Sunday spot after a long night of partying.   I use to walk in here and be greeted with the friendliest staff in the world!\\\\n\\\\nOne day I walked in here and everyone was gone. I believe that this place is now under new management and has gone down the drain dramatically.  I usually don\\'t rate this low unless it truely deserved it, based on service, atmosphere and food.\\\\n\\\\nFirst impressions..this place is completely dead nowadays.  We walked in and the hostess was completely glued to the tv. We were literally standing there for a good 5 mins until my brother cleared his throat lol.  We sat down and already knew what we wanted since we pretty much know the breakfast menu in and out.  We ordered two orders of the two egg breakfast with sausage with a side of bacon. She then brought out two orders one with bacon and one with sausage. We then went and explained to her we both had sausage with sides of bacon.  She then brought out another side of bacon, which looked like it was quickly microwaved and totally tasted like chewy crap.  The order of sausage? Nowhere to be found....\\\\n\\\\nWe then asked for our check we got charged for 2x\\'s sides of bacon and sausage. (the sausage was suppose to be included in the breakfast)  we didn\\'t even bother to say anything and just paid the bill.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all... The service was horrid.  The food has gone down the drain..What a bad experience. Back then I would have given this place a 4/5 easy.\\\\nFigures why they\\'re cutting hours and 2nd shift. This place needs help!\"\\n \\'If you are trying to pick between somewhere else and here, try the somewhere else first. Not bad for what\\\\\\'s around, which is not saying much. I work very close to here and have given them a ton of chances to impress and they always find a way to disappoint. Whether its extremely slow service, or screwing up orders, to watered down liquor, it\\\\\\'s ALWAYS something. At least when it was the old owners, the meals didn\\\\\\'t take 45 minutes to get, on a slow day. Sure, the old owners had their favorite bar patrons that they took care of first before you, but at least you would get your meal and drinks in a reasonable manner. Three times, when the food order was incorrect, the best I got was a \"Sorry\" as they walked away from the table. If you want proof, please visit. Otherwise, heed my review, there ARE WAY BETTER out there. McDonald\\\\\\'s is better than here, if only they served alcohol.\\'\\n \"Wayyyyy tooooo expensive. $$$$ Trop trop cher.\\\\n350$/2 and you have to share half the plates!!!\\\\nÀ 350$ pour 2 personnes, on ne devrait pas nous imposer de partager 2 entrées sur 3 et... le dessert!\\\\nSurtout quand ce n\\'est nulle part mentionné sur la carte. La nourriture est excellente, le service attentionnė mais pas assez pour justifier 3 plats sur 6 à 2 fourchettes dans la même assiette.\"\\n \"I want to like this place. It is close to home and affordable. However, horrible service and horrible food make for a horrible experience. \\\\n\\\\nWaited twenty minutes for a coffee refill before giving up and accepted it wasn\\'t coming. Food was cold. Couldn\\'t even get a water refill. \\\\n\\\\nHopefully service improves. I really do want to see this place improve.\"\\n \\'May 2010 - Stopped in for lunch, ordered the quesadilla. It was served cold and soggy, almost like it was dropped in water or something. Totally disgusting. Asked for it to be returned and then ordered Beef Dip, again cold and the beef was loaded with fat chunks! By then I had given up and left only to be charged for both dishes! Will NEVER return.\\'\\n \"What happened to Humpty\\'s?  It used to be a great inexpensive stop for Sunday brunch.  Today the coffee was terrible and the eggs Benedict was bland with a tablespoon of Bernaise sauce.  $3.00 for a cup of Coffee?\"\\n \\'New owner is afraid of people. I was going to ask her a question and she looked like she was going to cry!\\\\nThe food not very good and only one waitress is any good. The rest keep coming to the table and asking questions about what we ordered. I thought that was why the wrote it down in the first place.\\\\nThe other day when we were in there, it was not all that busy so the owner sent one of the waitresses home. Ten minutes later they got slammed. The owner does not seem to know how to help.\\\\nNever send staff home when you have stuff they can clean. Salt and pepper  shakers to fill!\\\\nI have been in hundreds of resturants across Canada and the United states\\\\n This one is below average.\\'\\n \"TERRIBLE SERVICE AND YOUR FOOD TASTES LIKE A HOME DEPOT. I\\'m sorry but I will never be returning under any circumstances. Plus it\\'s way too expensive for the way it looks AND tastes\"\\n \\'I get it, people get annoyed when someone says \" I\\\\\\'m from NY so I know good wings, pizza, subs, italian food, bagels etc\" and why doesn\\\\\\'t Charlotte have these things? \\\\n\\\\nbut generally I dismiss that because I have found all good versions of the above at some location. Nothing is ever the same as where you grow up- whether you\\\\\\'re from NY or from Albuquerque (or insert random hometown)\\\\n\\\\nBut that being said Substation II really reminded me of everything a meatball sub should NOT be...\\\\n\\\\nMy remembrance of a meatball sub:\\\\n\\\\nServed on a toasted hot garlicky Italian sub roll topped with oooey gooey mozzarella, three large homemade meatballs, and sauce that would put your Italian grandmother to shame.\\\\n\\\\nWhat I got - Salty McSalterson\\\\\\'s sauce and 10 mini meatballs that easily came from the frozen foods section. If that was what I wanted I would head over to HT and pick some up myself. Sadly this sub had little cheese to offer but luckily the bread was at least fresh. Do yourself a favor and for 50 cents extra head to subway and get their foot-long because essentially they are on the same caliber ...actually if I am honest, subways rivaled theirs. \\\\n\\\\nThey also have \"scrap\" sandwich on their menu ...I am not sure how this is suppose to sound appealing.\\\\n\\\\nThis will probably be my one and only visit here considering we have about 7 subshops within 2 minutes of my office. Yay Jersey Mikes !\\'\\n \\'This location is closed; email with folks indicate no reopening\\'\\n \"It took so long for them to get me and my family\\'s food and I we didn\\'t order a lot of stuff  and the pancakes were burnt and hard and if you put syrup on it it will get dry I\\'m not going back there again they will poison you\"\\n \\'The place is a replica of Zets breakfast. I ordered the chicken souvlaki which included rice and salad. The salad was not romaine lettuce, but regular lettuce, the chicken was bland, the restaurant was not busy at all.\\'\\n \"Ordered a Greek Chicken Salad with the shwarma chicken and advised no hot sauce on the chicken, just the white garlic sauce. I took it back to the office to eat a very dry salad without any greek dressing. Called the # and it says the Airport Grill is now closed and won\\'t be re-opening. What\\'s that about? I was just there 65 minutes ago??\"\\n \"This all day breakfast and steak place is located near the main runway at Pearson on Airport Road south of Derry Road. There is lots of parking and the space is quite large. They have a wide selection of quick steak meals as well as burgers, fries, and other grilled or deep fried foods. I had a steak on a bun and although the taste was OK, the steak soaked the bun making it difficult to eat with a knife and fork. However, the overall quality was OK.\\\\n\\\\nMy issue with this place is the cleanliness or lack of it. The place seemed dirty with many tables still holding used plates with old food. I don\\'t understand why that needs to be that way since the place had 3 people in there when I walked in.  I had to search for a table as far away from one that had old food and plates on it. The washroom is disgustingly dirty and I can\\'t understand why restaurants don\\'t pay more attention to this area.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s amazing how effective a fresh coat of paint and some clean washrooms can be in gaining loyalty from repeat customers. Until this place cleans up, I would never go back there. Zets offers similar food in a slightly cleaner environment and Zets Express is even cleaner.\"\\n \\'Absolute waste of money...food is garbage and arrived after over an hour later!\\'\\n \\'Food sucks.  Had the short rib sandwich and it was all flabby fat and gristle.  Service on outdoor patio was slow.  Why go back?\\'\\n \"I entered Shabu Fondue this evening anticipating a fun and filling meal. While fondue is always fun, I found this particular meal was lacking in the filling department. My husband and I ordered the cheese course for two (swiss and emmenthal cheeses with white wine and lemon), which was really delicious with apple slices and bread chunks. We followed up with steak and chicken (served with a selection of vegs and a hot, seasoned chicken broth). In retrospect, we should have given this course a miss and ordered more of the cheese! \\\\n\\\\nThe cheese course cost us $13.00 for two (portion size was very small), while the ribeye cost $15.95 and the chicken $14.95 (all prices exclusive of taxes). We both definitely felt that we would have been better off eating at The Melting Pot because, while it is more expensive, it offers better value -- bigger portions, a larger selection of meats and seafood, more choices in regards to cooking methods (oils and different kinds of broths), and fixed price menus for groups with 2+ people. \\\\n\\\\nThe atmosphere at Shabu was also lacking. A restaurant\\'s quality can often be measured by how many covers it has in an evening. On the day after Christmas Day a restaurant should be buzzing. Shabu was nearly empty.\\\\n\\\\nI will say that our server was quite excellent, though. She was attentive and a great conversationalist. If the food we had consumed had been to the same standard, I would definitely have rated this restaurant with 5 stars.\"\\n \\'The service was horrible!  Forever between courses, no wait staff was ever around.  Our waiter actually turned off the burner as he served our main course.  We could not cook our meal!!!  Then we couldn\\\\\\'t find anyone to turn the dang thing on.  It took 15 minutes for someone to appear where we could flag them down.  It was a Wednesday night and only 5 tables had customers, so no excuses there.  It was horrible.\\\\n\\\\nMy shrimp was freezer burned!  The broth was flavorless.  The dipping sauces are very strong, no mild choices. \\\\n\\\\nDid they offer free dessert for screwing up our meal, no, nothing but \"here\\\\\\'s your overpriced check\".\\\\n\\\\nMelting Pot is worth the extra money!\\'\\n \"This place is quite expensive, for a fondue experience that was kind of lacking. We had the Margarita cheese fondue, which was pretty good (soft pretzels, OMG), then he had shrimp and chicken, while I went with prime rib. His was soooooo boring. Mine was ok. The broth was forgettable, but the horseradish sauce was really good. My breath, not so much, but it made the meat much more interesting. Decent assortment of veggies, but I felt like I was in Munchkinland, with the portions. The dessert... well, who can go wrong with chocolate and caramel? Only chocolate and peanut butter would have topped that. \\\\n\\\\nThe service was... mmmm, well, I went with my standard 18%. It wasn\\'t bad, it wasn\\'t good. It just was. \\\\n\\\\nTwo stars for the experience falling way short of the usual fondue expectation, and for having to stop and get a something to munch afterwards.\"\\n \"I was a bit disappointed in the experience as a whole.  The food was meh, desert was pretty good, but way overpriced for what we got and not made for a big guy.  I\\'ve done fondue and been well full and satisfied, just not this time and not for what we spent.  Had the bread, vegetable cheese appetizer and the chicken, shrimp, and steak main.  Sauces were excellent, broth was meh again.  Desert is kinda hard to screw up but the chocolate was oily and clumpy, didn\\'t melt well.  The scenery was excellent and decor is what a modern restaurant should be. I won\\'t be back but try it yourself.\"\\n \\'Salade de choux vraiment passé date. \\\\nService long, et aucune serveuse ne te regarde donc on sait pas qui vas nous servir\\'\\n \"I really don\\'t recommend this place. The food is not good, service is bad. The entertainment is so cheesy. Not gooooodd\"\\n \\'It food is not bad, but not worth the money . But Customer service for sure is terrible they can even answer the phone and handle the booking. They sound very board and bothersome withe your call.\\'\\n \"This place is awful! The service is mediocre, the entertainment is cheesy, and the food is horrible. We ordered three plates of kabob and it took about an hour for our food to come. The rice tasted bad and the meat was cold. Both the appetizers and the main dishes were not prepared properly and had no taste. To make things worse we were billed $100.72 for three people! The restaurant owners have the nerve to charge an 18% gratuity for atrocious food and service.\\\\n\\\\nShiraz also has some novelties. If you ever go there check the vegetarian menu, they have a number of fish kabob dishes. Apparently the management doesn\\'t know the definition of the word vegetarian. \\\\n\\\\nOverall Shiraz has bad service, poorly prepared food, a highly overpriced menu, and bland entertainment. I would never recommend this place to anyone. \\\\nI\\'ve had better experiences with street food.\"\\n \"Service was poor and food was alright and a little overpriced. Entertainment was quite nice.\\\\n\\\\nService may have been poor due to inadequate organization by management, but some members were particularly rude to customers. Not the first time we\\'ve experienced this.\"\\n \\'Terrible food.\\\\n\\\\nI saw reviews on here saying there is good popcorn chicken and I work close by so I thought I\\\\\\'d try it out.\\\\n\\\\nGot there and asked for a popcorn chicken meal....\\\\n\\\\n\"We don\\\\\\'t have any cooked.\"\\\\n\\\\n\"Ok what about a 3 piece meal?\"\\\\n\\\\n\"Sorry we have no chicken cooked\"\\\\n\\\\n\"What do you have ready?\"\\\\n\\\\n\"Just wings.\"\\\\n\\\\n\"Ok give me a wing meal with honey garlic\"\\\\n\\\\n\"How many wings?\"\\\\n\\\\n\"Whatever comes in the meal.\" I look at the little piece of paper \"It says 6 here...give me 6.\"\\\\n\\\\n\"What size wedges?\"\\\\n\\\\n\"Whatever comes with the meal...a small I guess?\"\\\\n\\\\nGot my food and meal should be $7 with wings a pop and wedges according to their menu and I get charges $9 and change (tax I\\\\\\'m sure) and get no pop. I\\\\\\'m done though so I just leave.\\\\n\\\\nGet back to my work and open my food and the wings are cold and dry. I could have gotten better from the freezer section of the No Frills nearby, and the wedges are not seasoned in any way but taste like they were tossed in flour and also cold. Obviously everything was made hours ago and just sat under a lamp.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: I was trying to finish my wedges and got a sour taste in my mouth and discovers they couldn\\\\\\'t even be bothered to clean out the bad parts of the potatoes before cooking them. Big black spot that I got to bite into. Looked and found another just like it.\\'\\n \"I\\'m so grossed out right now, I got the Hungry Man combo to go with 4 pieces of chicken. When I arrived home I realized everything was COLD. Some pieces were sort of room temperature/COLD, some were kind of lukewarm but not warm enough to be good. This is not safe! Food must be kept at a certain temperature. It\\'s also rude to sell food that isn\\'t even at the proper temperature to taste good. Obviously the food had been sitting out all day and was cooked a long time ago. I would rather she told me the food was old so I could go elsewhere. The potato wedges were cold as well. If it were a normal restaurant I would storm back and return everything, but it\\'s a weird little hole in the wall in st Jamestown and I don\\'t need the drama. Never again!!!! Go to Popeyes instead, it\\'s pretty similar but not old, cold chicken. Ewww what a waste of $11.\"\\n \\'Scruffy\\\\\\'s is the very definition of grungy pub. I work pretty close to this pub so my meeting with this pub was bound to happen. \\\\n\\\\nLet me start of with the good things about this pub: \\\\n-Layout: Scruffy\\\\\\'s has a great layout, it is cozy enough to be a stop for a first date and large enough to accommodate large parties of 20+ guests. \\\\n-Servers: they are polite, will take your order and get it right more often than not (!!) which is surprising for a pub and even crack a joke once in a while \\\\n-Prices: drinks are cheap, assuming you don\\\\\\'t want anything too fancy ....grungy pub = cheap (local) drinks\\\\n\\\\nThat is unfortunately where the good things end. If you\\\\\\'re going to Scruffy\\\\\\'s for food, you will be disappointed. There\\\\\\'s no question in my mind about this fact: their food sucks. To top it off, it\\\\\\'s overpriced. There are countless other places with better food in the same intersection. \\\\n\\\\nFinally (this is the big reason they lose points), the service here is the WORST. You\\\\\\'re probably thinking, \"David, you said the staff is great. What gives?\". Well dear reader, although the staff is wonderful, the process this pub has set up to transfer food orders into food is very bad. \\\\n\\\\nStory time:\\\\nWent with some work buddies (about 7 of us in total) for a quick lunch and drinks. Ordered our food and began our never-ending wait. We get our drinks a little late (~15 minutes after ordering). We finish our drinks, and we\\\\\\'re told the food will be right there \"just order another round\". We order another round. Finish the 2nd round. No drinks. It\\\\\\'s been ~45 minutes by this time. Finally, almost an hour after ordering our food/drinks, all of our food arrives (together thank goodness). Our quick lunch+drinks turns into an hour and a half of waiting/\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, Scruffy\\\\\\'s is a great place to go for a quick drink, maybe some dirty food ....and that\\\\\\'s it. \\\\n\\\\nTL:DR: cheap drinks (nothing fancy), awesome layout, garbage food and horrible process flow\\'\\n \\'Went to a together here ; not sure why they picked this place but ok. \\\\n\\\\nThe place was understaffed with only one waitress on a saturday evening...which blew my mind. That being said, the wings, burger, and pepper poppers were great. the fried mozzarella sticks not so much. The appetizer portions should be bigger for the money.\\'\\n \"Frequent Disappointment.  This is yet another perfect example of a non-franchise establishment not being aware of their customer and thus dropping the proverbial ball.  Apparently under new management, there has been no change in food or environment despite the new management.  They have a no children rule after 9, which alienates them from potential customers who would order food and possibly imports and keeps the 5 patrons instead who continue to drink their bottom barrel domestic.  I don\\'t have a real big issue the kids after 9, but they turned away a party of 20 twice who were hungry and thirsty and instead catered to the 3 patrons at 9:00 PM on a weeknight.  Well done.  They carry the name Irish Pub, but it\\'s obvious they\\'ve never been to Ireland.  They are after all a family environment big on community.  The food is sub par and easily attainable at any of the neighbouring establishments and quite frankly better tasting.  It\\'s quite hard to screw up a pint so they do have that.  \\\\n\\\\nBack to the business plan drawing board.\"\\n \"I really wanted to believe in Cafe Soleil, but it didn\\'t live up to my expectations. We came here twice in one day: 1. early morning for pastries before hitting the Farmer\\'s Market and 2. to pick up some lunch before heading out of town on our way home. The first experience was ok. Hailing from France, I was secretly hoping for real French pastries. The baguette was dense and dry, the epi baguette seemed to be the best bread choice (though a tad dry), and the almond croissant, although deliciously almond-y, was quite heavy. Our second experience that day, however, left us frustrated. We ordered a house salad with grilled chicken to go. The menu described market greens and house vinaigrette-simple enough. 20 miles out of Madison we realized that we had slimy mustard greens, with mealy apples, extremely potent cheese (and believe me I can handle my cheese), and a few measly bites of chicken. $9 seemed outrageous for what looked like week old leftovers. \\\\n\\\\nPros: LOTS of organic products!!! They advertise themselves as using something like 97.99999% organic ingredients.\"\\n \\'Food was priced low but left my wife and i with an unsettled stomach. Place seems always packed so maybe just a bad batch of hash browns. May try a takeout meal to give them another try.\\'\\n \\'i have been craving oysters for a long time. got some from the grocery store and they were tiny so we came across Carolina seafood and decided to stop in. very nice man working there BUT we get home to eat our oysters and we found a freaky ass worm. just kind of thought the quality would have been better. seems like I have bad luck with oysters. bummer\\'\\n \\'This food truck is very poorly managed and operated.  The extreme long waits only to then get the order complete WRONG and then be so rude when I asked for my money back.  Bad service, badly managed, and not worth the wait.  The rudeness was UNACCEPTABLE when they knew they were wrong not to have the order tickets managed better.\\'\\n \"Why is it so difficult to find a decent salad bar here in PHX? This place doesn\\'t cut it- Its overpriced, and the food besides the salad is mediocre at best. Besides that, the salad items are very generic, nothing stands out as being original, unique or different. Skip it.\"\\n \"I feel bad about giving this place two stars... really.\\\\n\\\\nLast sunday, my mom and I were out on a power shopping spree at the pavillions when she said she wanted to go to Souper Salad, not wanting to i begruggingly agreed. We even dug through our back seat looking for their coupon in the sunday paper for a discount! We walked up and sat down and saw their DIRTY patio furniture... wtf?! Don\\'t these people own a hose?! That was so dirty, I couldn\\'t imagine trying to have a nice al fresco dining experience there! Luckily for me, it was the dirtiest part of the resturant.\\\\n\\\\nWe approached the door when a very loud man came and opened the door and exchanged pleasantries over and over again and was very happy to see us. Ummm... thanks? but can we atleast order our drinks first? He was a little happy. I unno - I was in a good mood, but I sorta just wanted to be left alone to eat. We got our salads and the greens were semi wilted and the cesar salad needed to be refilled but didn\\'t :( and so I was left with some odd franken salad I threw together on my own. It wasn\\'t that great - but that\\'s my own doing. \\\\n\\\\nTheir pasta salads and cole slaw and some of their fixin\\'s looked very old and unappetizing! I couldn\\'t even imagine eating them! I wished they had potato salad or carrot slaw (is that the word?) and macaroni salad... it wasn\\'t good. But things did lighten up when I came across the soups.\\\\n\\\\nI loooove soups!! They are my salvation after a hard day. I cozied up to a lil bowl of tomato based soup with mini shell pasta and veggies, it was delish! So was the Veggie Beef soup. I wish it didn\\'t have so much onion,but I\\'m not a big fan of onions. and their tacos were GOOOOOD... not write home and tell everyone about it good... but very good. They remind me of the kind of tacos you make at home, out of a box but not all craptastic like how they come out when I do it. I honestly liked it. \\\\n\\\\nThe cornbread was dry and my mom said her baked potato was too. The pizza looked too old to touch, so I unno about that one. \\\\n\\\\nThe service was another thing... the same man, who I\\'m assuming is the owner always kept talking. Even when my mom said something along the lines of just wanting to enjoy our meals and we thanked him for his hospitatlity. But damn... SHUT UP! I felt like he wanted to sit down and talk shop with us... but we weren\\'t there to meet with him... we were there to talk with one another. But he always refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly. So he got to keeep a star. \\\\n\\\\nTo my fellow yelpers: if you\\'re in the area and want fresh salads, this might not be the place for you... especially if you want to eat outside cafe style on nice clean patio furniture... but if you want a nice cozy bowl (or several like me) of soup and decent bread sticks then this place will hit the spot. You might need to shoo away the owner though in order to get some privacy and enjoy the people you arrive there with.\"\\n \"So disappointed in this place.  I come here a lot but it\\'s going down hill. Now I ask them to turn the tv to the game I want to watch and they said no.  No one is watching this tv but me!  I\\'m leaving and done with Loose Caboose.\"\\n \"After a long wait (-1 star) our food was not cold, but not hot (-1 star), but good tasting and expected portion sizes. Server gave me a good recommendation. I called ahead to confirm they were open for a 2pm lunch yet the dining room with the golf course view was closed and they were only serving in the cafe (-1 star).  Our server disappeared (he later said he went on a break) and the check never came and I had to go to the bar to investigate.\\\\n\\\\nSometimes restaurants in hotels aren\\'t the best. I won\\'t be back.\"\\n \"Went with a friend last night and picked Tatum\\'s because it was walking distance from her condo and we wanted a golf course view.  Sat on the patio and it was nice.  Ordered the french onion soup - bland, and the stuffed mushrooms which were good.   For our meal we ordered the prime rib sandwhich and the philly sandwich - one with tater tots and the other with cajun fries.  We send both our dishes back TWICE because the sandwiches were cold.  It was obvious that they just tried to microwave them because the meat came back very tough and leathery:-(  The waitress had the executive chef take care of it, in which when they came back the plates were hot as well as the food.  Both meals were just ok..I have had better sandwiches at Portillo\\'s.  Fries and tots were nothing special - pretty sure the tots are frozen ones that they just microwave - hence the amount of ketchup needed to eat them.  Waitress was very nice through all of this.  My friend works at a restaurant and I grew up in the grocery and restaurant business - were we too critical?  No, Tatum\\'s needs to work on their menu and their cooking.  Glad we did not order the pricey entrees.\"\\n \"I stepped into breakfast omelette counter but there\\'s no whole eggs left. How hard is that to drive 2 min to buy from sprouts? \\\\nI set down my Lipton hot tea and a cup holding my cooked spinach and chopped mushrooms on top of precooked chopped onion. When I returned from fruit section, I couldn\\'t locate my two cups, so I dug into trash cans to locate cooked spinach without hot tea.\\\\nOf course, it\\'s no big deal, I enjoyed conversations with Love..from Lo....na even I taught them what Dept of Health taught me while I bought lunch for him.  Splinkle\"\\n \\'Atmosphere is cool, staff was friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Rueben, which was a mistake.  Although tasty, it was almost all fat and grizzle. I really struggled to finish it, but was so hungry after a long day of travel that I just pretended to be a lion on the serengeti and took it down.  Would not eat there again, but a good place for drinks.\\'\\n \\'Picked this based on the two reviews. Its been 45 minutes since we saw our server. No appetizers yet. There are two servers and six tables. We have watched two orders go back to the chef, worried about our food. Food came, recommend burgers or sandwiches.\\'\\n \\'Tried breakfast, lunch, and dinner here, and the food was terrible.  The only nice features are the friendly dinner staff and the nice golf course view during the day.  Since those two features can be easily obtained elsewhere, I would not recommend this place.\\\\n\\\\nBreakfast- the eggs and sausages were fine, but the oatmeal was overcooked, and service was completely lacking despite the fact that the restaurant was not even half full.  \\\\n\\\\nSteak salad- ordered the steak medium rare.  It came overly smoked, completely overcooked, and tasted like beef jerky.  The spinach was also not fresh.\\\\n\\\\nVegetable soup- tasted fine, but nothing special. \\\\n\\\\nChicken Caesar- the dressing was fine, but the lettuce was somewhat blackened.  The chicken was also blackened and overcooked.  \\\\n\\\\nTater Tots- tasted fine, although a bit dry.  \\\\n\\\\nOverall, this is at best a two star restaurant.\\'\\n \\'The dirty table should have been a red flag. Went to the \"All You Can Eat\" fish fry...one serving was all I could eat. Never was given my tarter sauce or slaw...even AFTER I requested it. My granddaughter ordered the childrens spaghetti...she got bowtie pasta topped with salsa. Gulp...sorry...I threw up a little. The lettuce wraps had some surprises beneath the chunks of red onion...DRIED CHERRIES WEREN\\\\\\'T EVEN ON THE MENU! Really a sad deal...and no MANAGER to complain to...even the waiter was embarassed. I should have know when I watched him scarf a burger from Wendy\\\\\\'s on his break. They only charged me for the fish...still waiting for the Sprite my grandchild ordered...hope they deliver! For a great Fish Friday...hit the TEXAZ grill on Bethany and 16th street.\\'\\n \"The red room and accompanying lounge are very nice spaces, with a darker modern decor, it\\'s a great place to hang out and have a drink, but you should go somewhere else for food. The menu reads nicely but the execution is a bit clumsy, and the service takes years. \\\\n\\\\nso grab a couch a libation, and hang out, just dont open that menu\"\\n \"Ducked into this place while waiting for a table at Abay around the corner.  \\\\n\\\\n$25 for a glass of House Red  and a Kettle One tonic.  Where are we - NYC - LA?? ? \\\\n\\\\nNot to mention  - the waitstaff practically made me beg for it!   Waited for close to 10 min then had to stalk /chase one of the 2 bartenders to the other side of the bar.    The kicker is..... the bar had like 10 empty tables and the bar seating was 1/2 full!!!! \\\\n\\\\nHahahahahahahahaha\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1st  - time you get me - shame on you.... \\\\n2nd-  time.... shame on me... \\\\n\\\\nWon\\'t be a second time....  and that\\'s unfortunate cause it looks like it has potential.  ()based off of other reviews here - maybe I overstated its potential!!)\\\\n\\\\nNot to mention  - in a shady (not shadyside - and can\\'t even justify those prices there), if not the shadiest part of town.\"\\n \"came here for a triple birthday and the only thing i liked about this place was that a lot of my friends were there. i know it\\'s supposed to be more up-scale but shit, this place is still in east lib territory where i can get cheaper drinks at kelly\\'s bar and shadow (including a cover). i waited for 10 mins to order a drink even though there was barely anyone at the bar and 3 bartenders. i can get quicker service at phi bar at its fullest capacity with one bartender.\"\\n \"Hard to figure this place out.  It has a surprisingly hip decor for Pittsburgh, which seems trapped either in some smoky dive bar nightmare or early 80s design.  Despite the design and relatively attentive service I do have complaints.  There are flat screen tvs everywhere!  Can i find a nice bar in this stupid town w/o 10 tvs playing sports? Also, to ruin the night they had one guy poorly playing covers on an electric guitar, what was the point of that?\\\\n\\\\nThe drinks were good but the food there is terrible and overpriced.  I\\'d go there for drinks if there was no musician and they turned the damn televisions off!\\\\n\\\\nIt has potential, just needs some tweeking. 2.5 stars\"\\n \\'This business has closed, and judging by the \"sheriff\\\\\\'s sale\" postings, it will not be reopening... \\\\n\\\\nGone is the pleasure of the proprietors and waitstaff x-raying your wallet and checking how expensive your shoes look as you enter, that is, if they pay you any attention at all. No more sitting drinkless as the only customers during \"happy\" hour, while the owner shmoozes a liquor vendor (a woman who repeatedly used the word \"zing-fen-dale,\" no joke) in the comfy lounge seats next to you. \\\\n\\\\nSomeone needs to get the message: upscale (real or imagined) is not the only way to succeed on the developing East Liberty/Shadyside edge, no matter how desperately the Red Rooms and Richard Chens of the world may think so. Also, Pittsburgh can support only so many ersatz upscale restaurants, thank god. \\\\n\\\\nGood riddance, Red Room...\\'\\n \\'I really wanted to like this place.  I really did.  But the high prices, snooty wait staff and completely wrong-headed \"creativity\" of the chef (wrong-headed combinations of flavors) just turned me off.\\'\\n \"iI just visited the LJS restaurant in New Kensington on Nov. 8, 2012 after not having visited it in awhile and was hungry for the fish & hush puppies.  I could not get over\\\\nhow dirty the floor in the dining area was with paper and bits of garbage under almost all the tables.  It looks like it has\\'t been swept in awhile.  There was a broom and dust pan leaning up against the pop machine & I was tempted to use it myself to sweep up.  I think it will sure be a long while before I visit that location again.\"\\n \"Dirty, mismanaged. People behind counter can\\'t seem to keep the simplest order straight.\"\\n \\'Absolutely terrible. Less than mediocre. I ordered in advance and they hadn\\\\\\'t made it when I got there. The people who work there are also rude. Even though they made it \"fresh,\" my shawarma was cold and gross.

I think Amir\\\\\\'s is much better.\\'\\n \"un drole de gout chimique\\\\nassiette trop couteuse\\\\npeu de légumes \\\\npire resto libanais que j\\'ai gouté\"\\n \\'So, its Friday night and we decide to drive 40 miles to try Lone Star.  I asked my daughter to call and see if she can get us a reservation since I hate to wait.  She made the call and was told that we didnt need a reservation and \"they would take care of us when we got there\".  Okay?   When we walked in to the Lone Star there was 3 or 4 couples waiting to be seated and I was told it would be 15 minutes.  I asked if they accepted reservations and was told \"only for 6 or more people\".  How nice.  \\\\n\\\\nWe were seated about 15 minutes later and promptly waited on.  The server had no expression, no personality, no nothing....  Like a robot.  \\\\n\\\\nOur food was average and best and very salty.  It was nothing special and the bill was about $75.00 for two adults and two teenage girls.   \\\\n\\\\nWe will not be returning....\\'\\n \"Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I\\'ll try to be fair though but I\\'m writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing. So much so that I\\'m buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I\\'m in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn\\'t be breaking a 2.5 . I\\'m not in a good mood.  \\\\n\\\\nTexas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that\\'s not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.\\\\n\\\\nKid\\'s meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid\\'s meal I\\'ve met. Sure make a profit but don\\'t take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you\\'ve just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn\\'t. :( \\\\n\\\\nEntrees.\\\\n\\\\nCajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn\\'t find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn\\'t find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:) \\\\n\\\\nSirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned. \\\\n\\\\nSides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it\\'s texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.\\\\n\\\\nFried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible: \\\\n\\\\nSteak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok\\'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that\\'s for this occasion only , past two times it\\'s been great fun for the kid,)\\\\n\\\\n1.5 rounded to 1 for the carrots.\"\\n \\'Grade: D\\\\n\\\\nNice place. Nasty, overpriced food. Dopey but hot servers.\\'\\n \"it was restaurant week. we read over the menu & loved it. i called & left a message for a reservation. No one returned my call by the next afternoon, so i called again. i spoke with a man that said he was so sorry, but they had had a gas leak & ended up closed for a few days. we made reservations for tues., the 23rd at 6pm. he had my name  & #.\\\\nwe live in the s. hills, they\\'re in etna. tom left work early so he could come home & shower. we left & fought through rush hour traffic in 2 directions. we pulled up across the street from it, trying to find it. finally, we saw it, dark! dark, dark, dark!!! my hubby went to the door. there was a note saying, sorry, we\\'re closed still from a gas leak & frozen pipes! WHAT??? we just drove all the way over here, for nothing?! they didn\\'t even have the decency to call us! \\\\nNOT a good thing at all! i didn\\'t want to give them any stars, but i had to, so they just get 1.\"\\n \"This place has really gone downhill. It used to be great. The last couple times I\\'ve been the food was not great. The fried foods were over cooked and burnt on the outside but the inside was soggy. Service was good. I would pass next time you think about going here.\"\\n \"This place has pretty awesome food but the filth of the restaurant and the trash of the staff completely make the experience awkward and sour.  Oh and it\\'s a little pricey for being a diner/cafe.\"\\n \\'Went on a week night for an early dinner - there were not that many tables occupied.  First off, as soon as we walked through the door we were hit with a bad odor (it smelled like a sewage/ventilation problem?).  Having been there several times before, I knew not to expect ambiance and that is one thing, but it could really stand a good cleaning (everything just looked like it would be sticky to touch, the table had something that looked like a dead bug stuck to it, walls were splattered with who knows what, and the menus were FILTHY -  I could go on....).  \\\\n\\\\nWe started with a cup of french onion soup with a side of french bread (both delicious).  For the main dish we split the chicken crepe and chicken salad sandwich.  The sandwich was very good.  The crepe was really very, very rich.  Did not like that the crepe was folded and not stuffed, and there was too much sauce for our taste.  I have had this before but probably would not order it again.  Ordered a plain crepe with sugar.  This took FOREVER to come out.  In the meantime the waitress was nowhere to be found - she did not offer a refill on my coffee, nor did she clear the dishes.  There were only a handful of tables occupies, and I counted at least 3 females and 1 or 2 male staff, so as far as I was concerned there was no excuse.  When the dessert finally came, dirty dishes still on table, I asked for a coffee refill but never did get it.  And there was no apology for the wait.  The dessert crepe itself was so-so - soggy on the bottom from moisture.  My family said that they much prefer the crepes I make at home.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, a disappointment, as I would sooo love a decent crepe place nearby.\\'\\n \"Lazy bunch, always closing way before advertized. Ils sont paresseux et ferme toujours avant l\\'heure de fermeture.\"\\n \"Je sers mieux mon chien quand je lui donne sa gamelle. Frites posées sur le plateau 5 minutes avant le Burger. Burger d\\'ailleurs dégueulasse . Rien à rajouter\"\\n \"We went to the Sherway mall today as a family . We decided to try shaorma and it was our fist and last time to eat at that place . Service was horrible they were inpatient and rude. When it came time to the drinks they didn\\'t have any fountain drinks that they advertised , but noted by $2 each we could get the drinks we wanted in the bottle .\"\\n \"I was real disappointed eating here. I was walking buy and one employee ask me to try a sample. I say ok. I try it. Sample was good. I Decided to order. The Lettuce was brown. He was so cheap on the chicken. At the end of it I sat down and it was real dry. I went back up and said can I get some garlic sauce. He says it will cost 0.75 cents. Lol. I just spent $9.65 with a drink. I was like are u kidding. Now i understand that they might get this request a couple of times a day. But I am a customer. what\\'s the big deal I am the guy walking buy that was nice enough to show u some respect stop, try, and order. Just give a a drop of extra garlic for my dry cold chicken plate. Come on. Honest review the Food was ok. It looked old for sure. The veg\\'s were brown. Service was zero. I will not be eating here again I promise u that. .75 cents. We are already getting screwed with the gas prices. Now garlic is that expensive.\"\\n \\'This place was fun and tries very hard to please....but there are a few drawbacks and it falls short of many Montreal restaurants which easily get three stars. Most of the portions were way too small more suitable for people on diets. I ordered a salmon and shrimp main dish as part of the Tabledote, it was tasty and nicely presented on cool plate of black slate. Maybe there was one shrimp sliced in half and two or three bites of salmon on the skewer and that was it. Another skewer would have  satisfied. The beet and goat cheese salad was very light on the cheese about a teaspoon. My friends plates looked skimpy too with the exception of the steak frites. A glass of wine was included with the dinner but it had a few fruit flies floating in it. The server politely replaced it, but, the damage was already done.  In an attempt to be loungy and \"tres cool\" some housy/techno music was blasting everywhere making table conversation difficult. On the plus side it was a fun atmosphere and the presentation of the food was done creatively. It shouldn\\\\\\'t take too much to bring this place to a much higher standard. So I wont return until it gets there.\\'\\n \"Food was so greasy and oily... Please check before you eat here, worst Buffet I ever had, you are going to puke for sure After you eat here...that\\'s what it happened to me\"\\n \\'This place is a rundown shack. The buffet had no food. 3 pieces of fries. 2 broccolis. It was pretty much empty. We left because it was a joke. Just awful ..\\'\\n \"Don\\'t even....NO!  Words cannot really describe the lunch buffet.  The parking lot is empty for reason...enough said!\"\\n \"This place needs some cleaning!!!!!! We tried it because of the great reviews , the buffet was gross, the hibachi chicken was not bad, but just eating it in that dirty place wasn\\'t pleasant.\"\\n \"The lunch buffet was greasy and unappetizing.

The seating is ridiculous a table of 6 they palace u there if you are 4 they place 2 others with 10 seats not used right at your table what?? Food was ok too pricey for what they offer plus if you order alcohol you have to order food for 2 people Shisha included plus 1 plate of food 1 drink 1 coffee you pay close to 55$ plus ripe and tax!!! Ramses has changed so much over the years plus hearing drake and Kanye music all night not very fitting...:(\\'\\n \"This place has a lot of potential, but poor customer service takes away from the ambience and the quality of venue. Don\\'t be expected to be greeted at the door, if you\\'re lucky you may chase down a server to seat you-but the wait is not worth it. Better drive the extra 30 mins downtown and hit up exemplifying sheesha cafes like Gitana.\"\\n \"The shisha is really good, but the decor is really bad with no theme.... Everyone has to order a drink in order to smoke. And if you want to drink alcohol you have to order food. Your friend cannot order to eat and you drink the alcohol, if you drink you have to eat. They only accept cash, there is a machine to take out money who doesn\\'t work well and takes time. The service really sucks!!!!\"\\n \"Worst customer service ever !! I was looking forward to have shisha for a while already and so while I arrived in the early evening I wanted to be seated somewhere comfortable, the lady with blond hair seated me, along with my boyfriend in the most narrow and uncomfortable spot next to a wall and squished between a table next to us. Meanwhile the spacious and entire other side where ones could be seated also, was totally vacant ! And she, along with the other staff members basically were mocking us while I was asking them politely if I could possibly be seated there. After 5 prolonged minutes of speaking to them while remaining kind, they still refused to seat us elsewhere. The way they responded was totally disrespectful and making a client feel unworthy and they have most importantly lost a customer ! I\\'m going to let everyone know how they treat their clientele with a selfish demeanour.\"\\n \\'Food was bellow par (in that price range), was disappointed with my plate and waiter said \"I know we should take it off the menu\", why not tell me in advance? Place is tight, they try to fit way too many tables in their limited space. Took an hour an a half before we got our main. There\\\\\\'s way better places out there, don\\\\\\'t bother.\\'\\n \\'Wow I had such a terrible experience here. I took my 80 year old parents here because my mom wanted to treat us out for dinner.  The young waiter was extremely rude and impatient with us. We took a bit of time to order and asked him questions about what he recommended and he acted very annoyed. There were only 2 other tables taken in the restaurant at the time. Our food was nothing special and below our expectations given the previous reviews. I would not recommend this restaurant and will not return.\\'\\n \\'I am unhappy with my recent order at Master Italian Pizzeria. located at 19616 w. 130th street in Strongsville,OHio\\\\nI had a huge gathering at my home sunday  and ordered 6 pizzas.

Very , very unhappy that the coupon states up to 5 pizzas off and he received 10.00 off.\\\\nNot very good customer service\\'\\n \"I remember when this chain was pretty new, and the location in Albuquerque served up giant bowls of hot delicious noodles with perfect sauce. The mac & cheese... to die for. It was like the Chipotle of noodle places... fast, easy, fresh (-tasting, at least) and delicious, enough food to last you for a couple future meals. \\\\n\\\\nBut that was like, 5 years ago. And when I recently went to this location I was sooo disappointed. The portions have shrunk drastically. My alfredo sauce was chunky, the butter separated into a cold greasy puddle halfway through the meal. The noodles were a little too firm. And it was too expensive for such a lackluster bowl o pasta.\\\\n\\\\nMy boyfriend said the marinara sauce on his bowl was really good, and he\\'s a marinara fiend... so that\\'s the only reason it gets an extra star.\"\\n \"I was not impressed with this place much.  It is nice that they offer tofu as an alternative to meat for add-on\\'s in your noodles.  However, vegetarians beware: they cook on the same surfaces, and the tofu took 10 minutes longer to arrive than my other friends\\' chicken dishes.  The specials have decent prices, when you do a combo.  Otherwise, I think this place is over-priced and avoidable.\"\\n \"Like the restaurant says, it\\'s a primarily based noodle shop covering asian, american, and italian.  I didn\\'t expect too much since it looks like a typical fast food restaurant that you see at a shopping mall.  Well, needless to say it really wasn\\'t much. \\\\n\\\\nI ordered a Pad Thai when I first went there.  And it was tasteless.  Gave it a second try and ordered one of their recommended dishes.  It was better tasting than the Pad Thai, but not by much.  I pretty much bought a $11 dollar stomach ache. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'d rather heat up some cheap ramen in a microwave.\"\\n \"Okay, so for the most part the food seems edible, however I wouldn\\'t recommend getting the Asian dishes. You don\\'t go to Mexican food place and get a burger, don\\'t go here and get Pad Thai. First of all it was served with a lemon instead of a lime and the eggs were all in one big clump. It was as if I ordered scrambled egg with noodles. I wasn\\'t impressed.  I might go back and try something else . . . if I didn\\'t have any other options.\"\\n \"Bad, bad, bad... No breadsticks, no silverware, no clean tables. I think this place is gonna be closing it\\'s doors very soon.\"\\n \\'Tried to eat here on Saturday night.  I say \"tried\" because we never ended up seeing our server.  We were seated promptly in a section with only two tables full.  The thing is, our server never came.  Never.  No \"hello\", no \"I\\\\\\'ll be with you in a moment\", nothing.  Very strange, since the place was NOT busy.  A confused busboy walked by, and another waiter walked by, but nobody every came to our table.  WTF!?  We left after 10 minutes.  So, definitely give McGrath\\\\\\'s a try if you want to be ignored.\\'\\n \"Honestly, I don\\'t know why there\\'s two different pages for the same restaurant, but regardless this restaurant is CLOSED!\\\\n\\\\nI would\\'ve given the restaurant three stars for inconsistent service, but hurry up and mark this closed so you don\\'t give false hope of close seafood.\"\\n \\'Horribly slow service, empty restaurant, salty broth, EXCELLENT live oysters\\\\n\\\\n--server didn\\\\\\'t know the menu. Not seeing a \"raw bar\" platter, I asked for it, was rebuffed and then saw \"raw bar\" options in the separate drinks menu\\\\n--the live oysters were awesome. So tasty!\\\\n--restaurant is cavernous but there is no one dining here. \\\\n\\\\nGo try the oysters.\\'\\n \"I will bet my money that the fish is frozen!! It looks like those frozen breaded fish sticks that you get out of the box...remember when you were a kid?\\\\nThe salad was fine but the dressing I swear was the Kraft stuff - which is ok if that\\'s what you want......somehow I was wishing that we stayed home.\\\\nThe quality of the meal was pretty disappointing at best - so I dont remember anything else.\"\\n \\'Ho-hum. Why do we always wind up at average chain restaurants. I\\\\\\'m firmly placing blame on someone else, namely my partner. I like to plan, he doesn\\\\\\'t, so we wind up at average or less than average chain restaurants. \\\\n\\\\nWe tried to go see a movie late this afternoon but it winds up everything we wanted to see was sold out. So we perused Sport Mart for a while, got a couple deals and then he said: \"I\\\\\\'m really hungry.\" So it was between White Chocolate Grill and McGrath\\\\\\'s Fish House. Since we\\\\\\'d been to White Chocolate and McGrath\\\\\\'s would give me another opporunity to write a review on yelp we decided on McGrath\\\\\\'s. This was not the better of the two choices.\\\\n\\\\nThey seated us in a cavernous dining room that was empty save for two other groups of diners. In addition the room was very warm. I must depart from the review to let you know my partner is HOT, and not just in the way your dirty minds are thinking. So, shortly after being seated we\\\\\\'re both very uncomfortable.\\\\n\\\\nThe good news is the service from our waiter Adam was great. The food, well it was just okay. We started with the Calamari Rings which were, you guessed it, just okay. I ordered Wood Fired Salmon and he ordered a King\\\\\\'s Platter. The Salmon was far from wood-fired, grilled with some wood flavored seasoning sprinkled on it, I can do that at home. My partner\\\\\\'s platter was also just okay. He said there\\\\\\'s no reason to come back here. I have to say I must concur. \\\\n\\\\nAnother average chain restaurant. You can do better than this!\\'\\n \\'Tried to pop into White Chocolate Grill the other night only to find an hour and a half wait.  Should have waited!  Instead we walked across the parking lot and found a cheap seafood chain that is actually worse than Red Lobster.  Please stay away as you will only be disappointed by their failure at every turn.  The only reason for the second star was that our server was actually quite funny.  We probably should have been able to guess the quality of food we were in store for when the Mahi Mahi was $9.\\'\\n \"This place has changed owners and names. It actualy has two names now which makes it very confusing. Venues and 34 Easy. I am local and even I could not find this place . I had to call them. Once there service was slow food was so so for the pricey tag. My friend never got her side of hot sauce. They seemed under staffed as well. Won\\'t go back.\"\\n \\'I booked reservations for two online. Unfortunately, the caterer never received my reservation and, apparently, cancelled every reservation they had for the night. I was never notified about the cancellation. When we showed up for dinner, we found the Mozart Room closed and received lots of attitude from the person on the phone.\\'\\n \"Up on the second floor of the Pacific Mall, this small counter restaurant is reputed to make some really good food for affordable prices.  It is the no frills of no frills.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I got there it was late in the evening and about an hour or two from the mall closing.  It was the busiest of all of the counters in that section and price range.  The P.Mall is cramped at the best of times and it felt that way with even half the capacity in the area.\\\\n\\\\nNow the food looks good and there were so many selections that it was difficult to choose.  I saw they had shrimp in lobster sauce over rice.  It is a simple dish but I had not had it in ages so I ordered it.  \\\\n\\\\nNot how my dad used to make it and it was a little on the salty side, which I can do without.  In spite of that, I am not ready to give up on this little cubby hole though.  I\\'ll be back and hopefully they will give me reason to lift the review to something more respectable.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m hoping it was an \\'off dish\\' for them and that it will not happen again.\\\\n\\\\nRating:\\\\nFood 2/5\\\\nService 3/5\"\\n \"Definitely not an accommodating place at all. When I first came to this restaurant, I asked them if they can substitute their meat in a fried noodle dish with tofu instead. I told them that I was willing to pay extra for this substitution and was willing to wait longer for them to prepare it. Keep in mind that this was late afternoon and there were maybe only 5 other people in total in the food court, most of whom were already eating their meals and the worker was just lounging around. \\\\n\\\\nHe then told me that he could not substitute any meal with tofu instead of meat. First of all, tofu is cheaper than meat and I was willing to pay extra for it. Second of all, the restaurant that I went to next, RIGHT BESIDE this place, Casa Formosa, not only gladly substituted the meat for tofu for any of their dishes, but also let me choose what kind of tofu I wanted. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'m extremely disappointed since I know many Chinese vegetarians in the area who have converted due to their religion. I will point out that they do have 2 vegetarian dishes, however, having only 2 makes it get boring real quickly and it\\'s not like adding tofu to the pan instead of meat is hard. Terrible, terrible service.\"\\n \\'Cheap prices and big portions, but taste is a hit or miss. I had the shrimp on rice with egg and there was no real flavour in it. However, for the price of the portion, can I really complain? It filled me up for sure. I just wish there was a little salt or something in there to make it better.\\'\\n \"Chicken meal was listed for $6.85. Lady charged us $7. I mentioned to her and she\\'s like, raised price. Price was hand written in red marker on white label. I call bullshit.\"\\n \"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!! I wish I had found this website BEFORE wasting our time and money on this dive!!! I can\\'t believe they have the nerve to charge $10 to get into this pathetic dump... and the worse part is... we paid it!!  \\\\n\\\\nWe, like the others on who commented on this bar, were told this was a great place. A live band, awesome patio, a cool place to hang-out. Maybe once it was, some time long ago, but not anymore. There\\'s nothing cool or fun about it. \\\\n\\\\nAnd whatever you do, don\\'t forget to close your tab!! They\\'ll hold your card for ransom and charge you 20% gratuity to get it back!\"\\n \"Poor Sugar Daddy\\'s......... :( \\\\nThis place used to be a cool place to go in south Scottsdale that wasn\\'t THAT far for us that live in the east valley. \\\\nBut ever since CBNC closed after that shooting, the crowd that went there to cause trouble and not just have a good time started going to Sugar Daddy\\'s. And then Sugar Daddy\\'s went from a cool bar to  Daddy\\'s Ghetto House of Horrors! \\\\nTax problems, and then stabbing, after stabbing, after stabbing. WTF!?!?!?! \\\\nYou would think after the first stabbing they would have clean it up but it seems they haven\\'t. Which sucks cuz the place can be really cool place to go and hang outside and party. \\\\nI guess if you ever want to go to Sugar Daddy\\'s it better be during the day light hours and make sure you have on your full body armour. \\\\nSugar Daddy\\'s.........needs a Sugar Daddy, or a Voodoo Dr cuz there is some major bad MoJo going on at that place.\"\\n \"Have you ever had the feeling like your wife might be slipped something while ordering a drink, or molested on the way to the can? That is how I felt while celebrating a birthday here. \\\\n\\\\nThe place was down right creepy. \\\\n\\\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, I love me a dive bar. I can eat on the curb in Mexico. I am a very trusting person. \\\\n\\\\nI hated this place. \\\\n\\\\nThe drinks were ok, ther servers were not attentive, the decor and outside sitting area was cool.\"\\n \\'Nothing here to get excited about. Not sure if the place has changed hands recently, but I remember a lot of people telling me this was a hot spot a few years ago.\\\\n\\\\nAnyway, headed over on a Friday night about a year ago and the scene was pathetic. It had a low life gangster vibe to it, and it just felt dirty overall. The crowd was mostly punks.\\\\n\\\\nThe service was atrocious.\\'\\n \\'Let me set the mood for you: \\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s the first cool night in Phoenix in 17 years (at least it seems that way) cool breezes blow across the desert landscape, dry air has set in, The Redsox, Indians, and D\\\\\\'backs all have a 2 to 0 lead in their respective series, Manny Ramirez Just hit a 3 run walk off home run in the bottom of the 9th to win the Redsox play-off game, the Yankees lost in 11 innings!! \\\\n\\\\nI don\\\\\\'t think I could ask for a more perfect night, like God came down for 1 second and said \"Hey, I\\\\\\'ll make all your dreams come true buddy.\"\\\\n\\\\nEnter Sugar Daddy\\\\\\'s....\\\\n\\\\nA few ex-coworkers invited me here, and since it was close I head over after the Sox game concluded. I am not  a big fan of Scottsdale bars in general, but went to see some friends. I even brought a sweatshirt for a friend per her request, who was \"chilly\" (see the above description of the weather)First let me say,  the patio is pretty cool, you can sit outside and enjoy the weather, being next to Scottsdale Rd, isn\\\\\\'t so great, as wanna-be Hell\\\\\\'s Angels cruise by on their bikes, buzzing the place like Tom Cruise in Top Gun. All that aside they had live music, basically A Dashboard Confessionals style, emo-acoustic  band. They were entertaining. The drink prices are reasonable, though a friend of mine (a girl) was billed for 21 miller Lites, which she claimed, \"was impossible to drink in 4 hours\" I said, \"well it is Miller Lite, which is basically seltzer water, with a splash of hops and barely, so you really could of had 21 beers\" She proceeded to drive herself home, you do the math. \\\\nFor the crowd, it would be what you\\\\\\'d expect, but a little better than what you see in old town Scottsdale, people were more down to Earth here, and pretty cool and laid back. I had no problem with the crowd, it was mellow. \\\\nSo as my friends decided to leave I ventured into the \"labyrinth  inside, and let me say this place is huge. The decor is like something out  of a Robert Rodriguez movie (insert from Dusk Till Dawn) and The set of The Munsters.  To me it had no real identity and conflicted completely with the patio style of Mexican Cantina. Inside there are many areas to get lost in, and dark corners were I could imagine horny Scottsdalians making out, and participating in heavy petting. After locating the bathroom, using my onboard GPS system, I decided to sit at the patio bar to finish my drink. I struck up a conversation with 2 of the female bartenders, as they were attractive, and emo/punk/tatoo\\\\\\'d/angst looking. (I can\\\\\\'t help myself with girls like this sometimes) So one of The Donnas (reference to the rock-band of all girls that look the same) started to explain to me she spoke sign language, and could communicate this way. As we were talking she became more and more annoying, it is hard to believe that someone could sign, and be annoying, but it happened. I spoke to her, and found her to be rude, and somewhat obnoxious, it really just solidified my opinion of this place and left me with a bad taste in my mouth, like waking up in the morning after you had some cool-ranch Dorititos before bed. You try hard to remove the taste, brushing, mouth-wash, flossing, etc, but it just stays with you until you eat lunch.....Unfortunately  I haven\\\\\\'t eaten lunch yet.\\'\\n \\'If this place doesn\\\\\\'t serve as a case study of what \"wasted opportunity\" and \"terrible management\" looks like, then show me another place like Sugar Daddy\\\\\\'s that frighteningly resembles Chernobyl 1986.\\\\n\\\\nI chuckle now because several times, years ago, I would wait in a line to get into this place -- not on my own accord, mind you -- but because some of my buddies thought this place was the killer.  In fact, this place would be freaking AWESOME if it was plopped down on 3rd Street and Roosevelt.  But it had two major things working against it: 1) Their kickarse patio faces the lame part of Scottsdale Road, and 2) Their kickarse property is in the lame part of Scottsdale Road.\\\\n\\\\nGranted, I still wouldn\\\\\\'t go if this place was set in Old Town, but at least they wouldn\\\\\\'t be gasping for air while the distant, populated beach of Goldwater shrugs a casual shoulder.\\\\n\\\\nThis place just takes \\\\\\'whats wrong with the Scottsdale bar scene\\\\\\' to another level.  They actually started this genus of bars and moved it further along the street to Loco Patron, which, conveniently enough for those vertical-striped sharks without a tank, is the slightly less crippled version of Sugar Daddy\\\\\\'s.\\'\\n \"This place seems to be on its last leg.  I heard they were going to revamp it within the year but I don\\'t know what they can do to change the image.  Its a nice place but people just don\\'t go there.  Even when its packed it doesn\\'t boast the fun loving atmosphere it has the potential to.  Its tough to describe..........\\\\n\\\\nOutside patio is nice.\"\\n \"more like sugar deaddy\\'s.\\\\n\\\\nthis place slid and slid fast. when i moved here 5 years ago, it was a great place to grab some beers outside on the patio. on a thursday thru saturday night, you\\'d actually have a hard time finding a parking spot.\\\\n\\\\nnow, it\\'s like driving by a cemetery. after the tax deal, then all the fights that happen there, you couldn\\'t pay me to go to that place. ghost town would be how i\\'d describe it. so, i will. it\\'s a ghost town.\\\\n\\\\ntotal waste of a great place. put a fork in it.\"\\n \"Extremely disgusting and enraging experience speaking with the owner today. He talked to me like a child and tried to blame the error (delivery order) on me. We ended up in a shouting match and I gave him several chances to make it right, just by admitting the mistake. He just talked over me, and dismissed everything I said. I told him he was losing a customer, and he couldn\\'t care less. Never again.\"\\n \"I love salty food and their soup (lentil) was to salty for me. Waitress screwed up order and instead of fixing it, chef comes out to tell me that its not his fault but the waitresses. Didn\\'t really mind however he was unpleasant and made the meal even less enjoyable. Also heard him getting upset at waitress. Environment was not pleasant. Love to support small/ local places but can not recommend this one :/\"\\n \\'I do not recommend this airport restaurant.  On June 16th, 2017, I stopped here for a quick slice of pizza.  I ordered a slice of pepperoni, but was charged for a \"Brnx Bombr,\" whatever that is.\\\\n\\\\nAt first, the cashier told me my total charge for the slice of pepperoni pizza and a small water was $8.00, but then she rang me up with a different total that came to $10.05.  When I inquired about the difference, the cashier became irate and ridiculed me for my question.  I was shocked and offended by the cashier\\\\\\'s behavior.  She was very unprofessional.\\\\n\\\\nThe slice of pepperoni was $5.29 plus tax and was very greasy.  It reminded me of a $2.00 NYC slice.  The small Fiji water was $3.99 plus tax.  \\\\n\\\\nBetween the price, bad service and bad quality of food here, I do not recommend this airport restaurant.\\'\\n \"HMS HOST owns all the bars at CLT I\\'m told, and the two I\\'ve patronized serve very watered-down Jack Daniels.  Servers are good.\"\\n \\'HMS operates many, if not most, of the restaurants at the Charlotte Airport. This is a similar operation to OTG or Delaware North. They license the operation and run the various eateries and outlets in the same design, training and systems that the actual business runs. So you might not see \"Wendy\\\\\\'s\" on the receipt, but rather \"HMS Host.\"\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve had some decent experiences with HMS at CLT and a few crap ones. They definitely charge \"airport prices\" for their stuff.\\\\n\\\\nSo please be sure that when you\\\\\\'re reviewing the burger place, the sandwich place or the taco place, you\\\\\\'re reviewing the right business.\\\\n\\\\n[Review 11481 overall, 1261 of 2019.]\\'\\n \\'Okay, overpriced at an airport is a typical license to steal. But if the food s***s, well, then it\\\\\\'s really a MUST AVOID. Brookwood Farms, their BBQ wannabee falls flat. The \"pulled pork\" was ground down most of the way to baby food. Trick #1 for bad meat hidding. Game-over when you can tell when ground near a puree it STILL has grizzly, fatty meat content. The sauce was an acidic - \\\\\\'let\\\\\\'s try and hide any meat flavor b/e it\\\\\\'s not good\\\\\\' attempt. After you get to the next city you\\\\\\'ll still have indigestion. \\\\nEspecially for the price one has to call it what it is - crappy excuse for BBQ.\\'\\n \"Pretty blah, really.  \\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s fast food but with sit down prices and barely fast food taste.\\\\n\\\\nThe taco platter Jesse mentioned, is three street tacos on a styrofoam plate which has other little compartments filled with a a few spoonfuls of rice, beans, avocado sauce, and chopped lettuce.  They sprinkle a handful of chips over the top.\\\\n\\\\nThe meat isn\\'t char grilled, but steamed on a flat-top and is greasy/wet enough that the little tortillas break apart before you get halfway through the first one.  I ended up dumping the mix into a pile, tossing the tortillas, and eating it like cereal.  \\\\n\\\\nNot horrible, but also not worth the price.  The combos are $6.75 and drinks are extra ($2). so for $9 you get a pretty weak meal compared with other good/cheap Mexican places or decent sit down joints with service.\"\\n \"Other than being located right next to the theater, there wasn\\'t much I enjoyed about my experience here.  Well, I guess my Peroni was cold.   The food was mediocre at best and the service, while prompt, was anything but friendly.   For the price there are better options within striking distance of playhouse square.\"\\n \"Because of its location (inside Playhouse Square) people attend Acappella for one reason: to make it to their show on time.\\\\n\\\\nIn the past I\\'ve gone to Acappella and I\\'ve had decent Italian-American food for a fair price, and I\\'ve always made it to the show for curtain. Yesterday, however, I went to Acappella to see a 1PM show with my boyfriend and grandmother, and I had to leave in disgust without eating lunch. \\\\n\\\\nWe arrived at 11:45, and the restaurant wasn\\'t full. However, the wait staff appeared to be in their own world and they didn\\'t even provide us with menus (we had to go up to the hostess stand and take them ourselves). At 12:30 I asked the waitress for the ETA on our 2 pasta dishes and bowl of soup, and she informed me that the cook hadn\\'t even started preparing them. By 12:45 we still hadn\\'t been served and left.\\\\n\\\\nIn total the three of us each had some coffee and a slice of bread before the show. At no point did the wait staff let us know that they weren\\'t able to serve us in a timely fashion, and they didn\\'t even bother to provide us with gift cards or anything else to salvage their reputation.\\\\n\\\\nThe only reason I\\'m giving Acappella 2 stars is because in the past they have done a good job, and I\\'m hoping that yesterday was a fluke for them. However, after yesterday\\'s experience, I don\\'t think I\\'ll bother going to them again.\"\\n \"Never been there ... scared away by the name. \\\\n\\\\nBut I read an article that it had closed Sat. 4-11-09 so I wanted to verify that was the case so I can add it to my list of  closed businesses and things that aren\\'t there anymore.\\\\n\\\\nhttp://thedish.freedomblogging.com/2009/04/09/is-better-than-sex-cake-cafe-closing-saturday/6115/\\\\n\\\\nIndeed it was closed.

But on 12/31/05 something was off, way off.  My dinner (Chicken Oscar) came out cold and I found a couple of crab shells.  My partner\\'s dinner (Steak) came out way under-done (Medium Well was requested and we got Rare).  We sent it back to the kitchen and got fresh meals which were done properly  but okay at best.  Service was painfully slow and inattentive and they really didn\\'t seem THAT busy.  We let them know how disappointed we were (verbally that night and in writing thru one of their comment cards) and other than 1 free dessert following dinner, had no response.  We\\'ll have to think twice before going there for dinner again.  It\\'s such a lovely place though and we had a nice time in the bar prior to dinner, so I\\'ll give them an extra star for those efforts.\"\\n \"There\\'s an old adage: never order chicken at a steak house.  \\\\n\\\\nA great space (high ceilings, cute little alcoves with leather sofas) undone by lack luster service and mediocre meals.  Also, somebody will have to explain hosting a large restaurant to me sometime.  Call me naive but when there\\'s a 45 minute for a table yet the dining room seems empty, it looks like somebody screwed up.\"\\n \"I went to Fitch\\'s for lunch last week and was very disappointed.  The reastaurant was empty at 12:15 and no one seated us or came out to the door for close to five minutes.  We wondered if it was closed but did see a few people eating.  It was dark - can\\'t read the menu dark and freezing cold.  My salad was so drenched in dressing that I really couldn\\'t eat it (my fault I didn\\'t ask for dressing on the side?).  I give them two stars because fortunately it is no smoking and the waiter was ok.\"\\n \"Pretty awful. Worst eggrolls I\\'ve ever tasted, and lets be honest...there\\'s a LOT of bad Chinese food out there! The rest is starchy, gelatinous and just gross. They\\'re close, but not worth it.\"\\n \"We usually frequent another chinese restaraunts in our area, but after receiving a flyer in the mail with a coupon we decided to try Oakridge Phoenix....horrible idea.\\\\n\\\\nWe ordered spring rolls and pork gyozas/dumpling.  Both were very fried to a dark brown making them quite dry.  The dumpling filling was an odd flavor unlike any I\\'ve had before.  The spring roll was hideously sweet, from what I don\\'t know.  Neither had a fresh vegetable taste, they were more like they had been mixed with the meat ages ago and became muddy.  \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered Pork Egg Foo Young  which was literally just egg, carrots, peas and sprouts.  Though the veggies were at least fresh the whole thing was devoid of any seasoning or flavor.  Also most places serve it with some kind of sauce, there was none.  Just a huge hunk of egg and veggies, that\\'s it.  \\\\n\\\\nWe also ordered almond soo gai.  Again this was fried within a shade of being black.  The chicken inside was so dry it was not edible.  I would guess they were frozen for far too long and acquired freezer burn.  \\\\n\\\\nFinally the coupon was for a free order of Chicken fried  rice.  It was literally rice and chicken with a few peas sprinkled on top.  Again no flavor, no seasoning and the chicken was dry as dry can be.  The rice was oddly plump and hard.  \\\\n\\\\nNeedless to say we will not try this place again.  Clearly they are cutting corners by over freezing food that doesn\\'t get rotated frequently enough.  And I\\'ve never had such bland or oddly flavored food, especially chinese food.\"\\n \"In a word... Gross!  When u can\\'t tell what\\'s chicken and what\\'s pita bread ... And the pita bread is better and those rubber chicken like strips!  \\'Homemade sandwich bread doughy... ugh... The good ...... really? !!! reviews must be written by owners or employees!   Too many good places around.  Stay away from this dive..and a cooler leaking all over floor tiles broken .. Nasty\"\\n \\'I got the spicy chicken with \"extra\" vegetables, a total ripoff and the chicken was grey! 7 dollars I will never be spending again let alone a cent going back here.\\'\\n \\'Wow quite the reno and money spent. It was empty though and for good reason. Caesar Salad was very wrong. Way too Salty. And why go so up market and not make a real salad at the table. Perhaps because our waiter was 18 and had little on how to properly serve. Food was ok but not amazing. Too bad as it is an amazing space. Hopefully they get it together as there is endless competition.\\'\\n \"Terrible service, and my Ahi salad was tasteless. I requested dressing and wasabi. The server stated they didn\\'t have any. Seriously? I was with a party of eight, and both our drinks and meals were served in shifts. 20 minutes for a glass of wine. Food was served without silverware and upon completion, we sat in front of empty dishes until we left.  Not impressed. I will not be back.\"\\n \\'I am rating this bar with a one star. They just had us pay for somebody elses bill. Which was $28.11 for what they claim was 1 shot of crown. I do not recommend this bar. We had a going away party and spent $100s of dollars. But because the bartender messed up we got charged $28.00 for one shot to fix their error.\\'\\n \\'this place had an issue w/ holding a reservation.  my buddy made a reservation and each time he called to confirm it, they said it they never heard of our party.  that\\\\\\'s shady.  anyways, when we finally got there, there was a reservation but we really didn\\\\\\'t need it as it was really empty and it was a friday night.  we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service.  \\\\n\\\\nwe sat on down and ordered our food.  the meaties had the orange peel chicken, red curry chicken and honey walnut shrimp.  the veggies had pad thai and i\\\\\\'m not sure since i didn\\\\\\'t really have anything from those selections.  the red curry was good, orange peel was decent and the walnuts in the honey walnut were over caramelized and got stuck in my teeth.\\\\n\\\\nwe got a crappy sake recommendation that literally tasted like bitter water.  yuck!  we did get some dessert but that wasn\\\\\\'t decent at best.  one was a rich chocolate cake and the other was a \"heavenly\" white cake.  sounds good in theory but just alright.\\\\n\\\\nthe place felt like it was trying to be a PF Chang\\\\\\'s but doesn\\\\\\'t come close.  the weird thing is that the place tries to push thai food as its specialty but it\\\\\\'s really not and has a lot of chinese plates.  so a confused restaurant w/ a schizo menu.  find some place else to eat...\\'\\n \"The service was good and the decor cool but I found the food to be disappointing. It was mediocre at best.   The pad thai tasted too limey. The curry peanut sauce for the princess tofu didn\\'t have much flavor.  The firecracker fish is spicy so watch out.  There are better restaurants out there.\"\\n \\'THAIFOON IS CLOSED!\\\\n\\\\nI heard rumors, but I drove by tonight just to see for myself.  Sure enough, sign is down and space is completely empty.  Do you think it was because of the 2 star yelp reviews?\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, DISH is open!  Review on that coming soon :)\\'\\n \\'First off, let me explain what the HELL I was doing at a horrible chain restaurant (I don\\\\\\'t even feel comfortable calling this pre-fab big box pre-frozen place a \"restaurant\"). I just started a job in Office Space near by on Elliot and needed a place I could get to, get served and get out within an hour with my friend on my dinner break. As we cruised Elliot, the lights blinking of Wal Marts, Costcos, JcPennys, and all the gruesome fast food chains like a garish consumerist Las Vegas, I decided on Chillis b/c at least their memory had not been horrendous. \\\\n\\\\nThe last time I ate at one of these, it was TEN years ago-when I was 17. It was next to Borders Books in NJ, and I thought it was kind of sophisticated (hey, I had been brought up on Malls, okay?). \\\\n\\\\nThe decor of this place confused me. The bar is right at the entrance with a supremely low ceiling. Seated at a tall table with some plush booths on the side and surrounded by five televisions, the waiter was fast with the iced teas. The bar was actually designed kind of cool, with beers in ice on the bar, kind of like the practice of picking out lobsters out of tanks. The drinks were disgusting looking (not our iced teas-they were fine-if served in PLASTIC beer mugs) in the menu, with all drinks mysteriously splashing and semen-resembling.\\\\n\\\\nThe decor...okay, there were also windows that looked out back into the restaurant...I mean I don\\\\\\'t understand. Is it supposed to be bohemian? Like a \"mexican shack\"? Country? The decor confuses me instead of comforts me. I feel like I am in a bad stage set of a western town, like a rompus room for tourist\\\\\\'s kids or something.\\\\n\\\\nWe ended up with Southwestern Egg Rolls (which has like pureed chicken in it) and I did sneak a taste (yummy in the worst for you way-better than I remembered-but guarenteed to make my vegetarian stomach shrivel up and die) and the chocolate molten cake, which was OUT OF CONTROL. A fucking huge chocolate cake with hot fudge stuff inside a huge dent, with a large vanilla scoop of ice cream encased in a hard chocolate shell. \\\\n\\\\nThese things were fine, standard, but expensive. Do people realize they are paying like 7 bucks for an appetizer and like 6 bucks for a dessert they could get a LOT more for their money at an independent \"real\" restaurant?\\\\n\\\\nThe stars go to the service-all nice, helpful, and not in a scary generic way. \\\\n\\\\nAs David B. said...this Chilli\\\\\\'s isn\\\\\\'t a lot different than the one on Mill...or anywhere else in the world.\\'\\n \"I came here with the family the day after Thanksgiving to watch some football. We ordered some boneless wings that were pretty good and Miller Lites that were on special for $3. The bartender/server seemed pretty annoyed to be working and wasn\\'t very attentive, even though the place was empty. After we finished the wings we ordered some more food. This food was bad, a few burgers and some sort of soft taco plate. Nothing was good. \\\\nThe televisions are very outdated as well, no HD, flat screens, plasmas, or LCDs. Just small 20 inchers and some very large projection screens. The video quality was very poor, the projection screens were very washed out, to where you could barely view. The small TVs didn\\'t have a clear picture. I would think if you advertise so much as being a sports bar as they do, the TVs would be up-to-date.\\\\nI was really disappointed in this place, I love hot wings and beer, I thought it would be a good spot.\"\\n \"Order the seafood salad shrimp, crab and little tiny pieces of lobster. Where are they? The dressing was zesty, just the way I like the dressing. Not bad for $8.95.\\\\n\\\\nFor my main entree I order a paradise roll $12.95 crab, shrimp, roe, asparagus and deep fried. What a disappointment, I thought it was going to be this 8 section fatty roll but it was a scrawny roll.\\\\n\\\\nPortions were small and I was hungry. I\\'ll keep looking for more Japanese restuarants in Montreal.\"\\n \\'Nous étions venu à ce resto dans une autre vie...\\\\n\\\\nCe soir:\\\\n\\\\nSoupe Tom Yum crevette... Son bouillon est sans saveur, plein d\\\\\\'oignons et sans ce peitit goût de coco.  C\\\\\\'est pas les deux crevettes qui feront la différence. \\\\n\\\\nRouleaux impériaux: beaucoup trop de cinq épices avec une sauce amère franchement pas bonne.  Hey les boys, ya internet pour des suggestion de recettes.\\\\n\\\\nAu tour des sushi:  que dire \"on mange d abord avec les yeux\" et il aurait fallu des clients aveugles.  La pire présentation de sushi de toute ma vie.  C\\\\\\'est comme une habit brune avec des bas blancs.\\\\n\\\\nLeur look n\\\\\\'avait d égale que leur goût!\\\\n\\\\nUnagi-nigiri sushi complètement froid ... \\\\nDe plus les rouleaux étaient si \"loose\" que tout risquait l effondrement à tout momment.\\\\n\\\\nEt j\\\\\\'en passe\\\\n\\\\nOK, doggy bag.. Et cette fois ce sera vraiment pour Pitou!\\\\n\\\\nDésolé pour le proprio hyper-sympathique que j ai reconnu du temps de DaGiovani... Vous avez besoins monsieur de nouveau chef.\\\\n\\\\nTennons nous loins.\\'\\n \\'Just left there after ordering a family pack, one of my sandwiches was supposed to have chicken instead of steak. All the sandwiches had steak-umms, when I called to let them know the lady got snippy instead of being apologetic, save yourself the headache of patronizing this sub par overpriced establishment!\\'\\n \\'I placed an uber eats order with them and it was delivered incorrect.  I paid extra money to get bacon that i did not get. I had a total of 4 fries in my large fry order and I ordered a orange pop that was not given to my uber driver to give to me. I went to the store to let them know things were wrong with my order and the owner cut me off from talking and said \"let me talk first, then you go\" she went on to read my order to me and show me irreverent receipts. I then asked her if I could now talk and let her know why I am here. She admitted I did not get my drink but argued with me about my other concerns, she says she watched her husband put the bacon on my sandwich even though I told her he did not. She wanted me to stay in the store and wait for her to replay they video of him putting bacon on my sandwich.  I told her I did not have time to do that due to me having to get back to work. But who in they right mind would argue with a paying customer. Before leaving she then told me, I don\\\\\\'t need to be using uber and that uber is for ppl who don\\\\\\'t have a car or can\\\\\\'t get out the house. She said I\\\\\\'m paying more through uber than I have to. I explained to her that even though I have a car, I can not always leave my job and yes I know I paid more but I paid for the convenience which came out to be the exact opposite.  I will NEVER spend any of my money with them ever again\\'\\n \"I hate giving this type of review.. But they don\\'t wash their hands. She will come from outside go to the register collect the money and then start helping him with the food. Just nasty!! This is the 2nd time I had to ask her to wash her hands or give me my money back.. I\\'m sorry no more chances. But I will say she is nice but just nasty.\"\\n \"I would actually like to give them a -1. We went there yesterday around 8:30 and the sign in the door says they closed at 9:00. Another lady was talking to the person who worked there and she said they close at 830 so they can clean. What\\'s up with that? Any retail place I worked at we would close the store at closing time and then do what we needed to get the store ready for the next day not close a half hour early and miss out for sales.\"\\n \"I visited Dish 1st week of September. The one thing I realized about this place was how overpriced everything was. Breakfast burrito - $9? Grilled chicken that was laying out in the deli  (no sauce or condiments) $8? There is another place like Dish that sells the exact same chicken for $5. I order the pizza at the restaurant and it was a really salty. I should have just went to Domino\\'s.\\\\n\\\\nI really had a hard time believing the prices they are charging for a grilled sandwich (almost $10) to pasta. Are you kidding me? Then I realized I\\'m in Scottsdale where people will eat anything in front of them as long as that place looks trendy (see Olive and Ivy). \\\\n\\\\nThe concept is pretty good. You can pick up stuff for home if you don\\'t have time to make anything. I think the prices are restaurant prices for a take out place. \\\\n\\\\nI think the location of Dish will attract considerable traffic. It\\'s a huge place that offers pick up and a sit down restaurant. Most of the employees knew what they were talking about and were friendly. But, it\\'s vastly overpriced for what they offer.\\\\n\\\\nUpdate 9/12/07: People have said that the food is pricey, but it\\'s Scottsdale...so it comes with the territory. That\\'s what\\'s wrong with most people. Location should not justify the prices, the food should. Actually, I don\\'t mind spending money if the food is worth it (in fact, my favorite local seafood restaurant is Wildfish, not inexpensive). \\\\n\\\\nBut, the food is alright compared to the prices. If you\\'re a bit lazy and can\\'t make a sandwich yourself at home, then by all means..spend $10+ for a sandwich here.  I think this is definitely catering to the right crowd.  This place is a larger, overpriced LGO with marginal food. I\\'ve tried the pizza, grilled chicken sandwich, burrito, and sushi. All were OK.  Perhaps, I am fortunate that my client/work pays whenever I go there. I think there are other places I would go to spend my OWN money.\\\\n\\\\nI think Dish will do well because of it\\'s location and because it is Scottsdale..where most people don\\'t have a discerning taste bud.  \\\\n\\\\nOne positive thing I will say is that it\\'s a quick, easy place to get a meal and the employees seem knowledgeable about what they sell. So, if you\\'re not in the mood to cook or even sure what to eat, but want a myriad of overpriced choices then Dish is for you. \\\\n\\\\nAgain, this is a personal opinion. I\\'m not trying to offend anyone.\"\\n \\'I give them a 2 not a 1 because they actually had the best ribs ever!. They were over priced and the corn bread and various other things had trans fat in it. I confronted the president to alert them of my finding. \\\\nI told them I saw it listed in the ingredients on the corn bread. \\\\nThen questioned why have a bakery and have fresh baked bread when your using the ingredients of a sit on the shelf forever and not go bad bread?\\\\n\\\\nShe wrote back and told me they called the chef and they dont use it. \\\\nWTF?\\\\nIts on the ingredients on the package, you idiot.\\\\nShe didnt even know what was in the food so she told me a lie.\\\\n\\\\nWeird, they didnt even make a lot of the stuff there. Thats why she didnt know\\'\\n \"Too bad this restaurant couldn\\'t work out all of the kinks I pointed out in my original review. Sadly, I saw Dish closing 6 months ago.\"\\n \"Chase G.? That\\'s a big ole fail on you. 240 N. Sunway in Gilbert is, in fact, a tire store. Thanks for ruining my lunch small dancing rodent!!\"\\n \"I so wanted to like this place.  Stopped in on a Thursday night, giddy with dessert excitement.  It took awhile for someone to acknowledge us and take our order.  The waitstaff seemed stressed, annoyed, and inexperienced.  But at this point I\\'m still thinking it\\'s all going to be worth it.  What a disappointment.  The desserts we tried were bland and dry.  I tend to like things that aren\\'t overly sweet, so it\\'s not that I was expecting an explosion of sweetness and flavor, but I was expecting *some* flavor.  Especially for the price!  Maybe they have something worth eating, but I\\'m not going to waste any more of my time or money to find out.  The one plus - the water must be filtered because it was actually drinkable.\"\\n \"I\\'ve always wondered about this place and finally tried it out with a friend who has been before.\\\\n\\\\nTo begin, you should be coming here with a truckstop diner mentality. Don\\'t expect a hipstery brunch joint serving chorizo bennies with a side of duck fat avocado fries (oh man, i don\\'t know if that\\'s even a thing but i want it to be now!) This is a truckstop diner in all its glory. Large portions, probably oversalted food, very efficient service (truckstop servers are my favourite for this reason), retro diner ambience (but not forced retro), and neverending coffee.\\\\n\\\\nI got the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes, gravy, and steamed veg. Very salty, even for a sodiumphile like myself. Also tried the pierogies and sausage which were alright, as well as the hamburger steak.\\\\n\\\\nProbably a great option for those lazy weekend mornings when you feel like going out for a huge, greasy, breakfast but don\\'t want to line up with everyone else for the newest, cool, brunch place. +1 for credit card pay phones at some tables and the wall of stuffed husky toy animals at the front.\"\\n \\'The Cleveland Grill has sadly gone out of business.\\'\\n \\'Service is good 6 oz steak plain and tiny the size of a golf ball not worth the 23 bucks\\'\\n \\'While John\\\\\\'s (our server) performance was impeccable, I doubt we\\\\\\'ll be returning any time soon. My crab cake was VERY fishy tasting and Tuesday\\\\\\'s only offered a very blah cocktail sauce - no teriyaki, soy or other flavor masker. My bride\\\\\\'s chicken fresco was noticeably dry and her favorite vegetable, steamed broccoli, was not warm enough to melt the \"butter\" that John served after being asked for it. Her mashed cauliflower (which she couldn\\\\\\'t bring herself to insist I try) was \"not quite what I remember\".\\\\n\\\\nWe didn\\\\\\'t partake of the salad bar ... it was nicely presented but compared to Dessey\\\\\\'s or a Sizzler it was seriously lacking.\\\\n\\\\nBottom line, if we get another ($10 max) 2 for 1 coupon we might return for a (see previous ratings) highly rated turkey burger. On the other hand, In-N-Out  is hard to resist when it come to burgers.\\\\n\\\\nBTW, I\\\\\\'m glad we didn\\\\\\'t take the (5 & 13) kids with us. There was nothing that would have appealed to them on the menu and we\\\\\\'d have had to stop at McDonald\\\\\\'s to feed them later.\\'\\n \"I don\\'t know what is up with this Ruby\\'s. I have had very good experiences at other locations but from now on I avoid this one. \\\\n\\\\nThe server never came back to check on us, I asked for my burger medium rare and it was well done, and the waiter kept making weird comments to people at our table. For the price of the meal I would have been better off staying home and wouldn\\'t have had to put up with such awful service.\"\\n \"My girlfriend wanted to eat here since we\\'ve seen the commercials down in So Cal. Now I have eaten at a Ruby Tuesday before in Cleveland, OH, and I thought this one would be the same as its midwestern counterpart. Wow, this Ruby Tuesday was completely different. From the outside it looked like a Cocos or Sizzler. The Ruby Tuesday in Cleveland looked and felt like an upscale Chilis but with a better menu. They even had Stella Artois (my favorite beer) on tap!\\\\n\\\\nThe service here was okay at best, but the food was disappointing, especially after having an amazing experience at another RT. If you want to eat at a Ruby Tuesday, you might as well go to one in the midwest. Stay away from this one.\"\\n \\'Food was awful, the restaurant was filthy (Health Department should be involved), bugs crawling around ankles and human feces around the toilet.\\'\\n \"Went in with a restaurant.com certificate. Was told it was no good on Fridays. Told waitress there was no date restriction on the certificate. She said they would accept it but I had to spend $50, not the $35 stated on the certificate. She said the manager changed the rules and it wouldn\\'t  help to talk to him. A lady at the next table waved her certificate, she had the same problem. If the owner contracts with restaurant.com to sell discounted certificates, he should honor the contract!  We left never to return.\"\\n \\'I went here for the first time with a group of people and we all tried different items, the only items that were good were the mussels. Everything else was poor over priced food. Stay away!!!\\'\\n \"Absolutely the worst experience I\\'ve ever had at a restaurant. Went in with a restaurant.com certificate, and after we had ordered our food, the waitress tells us that the certificate was no good because the manager made a mistake with the gift certificate and we would have to pay full price. I asked to see the manager and the waitress started yelling at me, saying that was the policy and the manager was not available.  I was astounded because: A) this was the restaurants fault and I should not be punished for their ineptitude and B) the waitress ended up yelling at me when I had simply asked to see the manager.  \\\\n\\\\nAs this was by far the worst service I have ever seen at any establishment, I did not leave a tip which which resulted in the waitress chasing me into the parking lot yelling obscenities at me. \\\\n\\\\nAside from this incident, the food was mediocre and overpriced, and I would not return there even without the debacle.  Stay away.\"\\n \\'I am not in the habit of dissing restaurants. However, I owe it to the unsuspecting to do so now. Bathroom:filthy. Service: waited an hour for food. Quality:oysters were not edible--set them aside and ate the overlooked shrimp and fries.\\'\\n \\'No stars. Lobby and outside disgusting. Kitchen door open to outside and no screens to keep flies out. Was looking forward to some good seafood....ugh.\\'\\n \\'Terrible service.  Awful food do not eat here. Awful on both counts. Just terrible. I had to beg for service. The food took forever and was almost inedible. Do not eat here. Then the obnoxious trivia game began. I could not get out fast enough\\'\\n \"The food is horrible; It\\'s all frozen processed food and way over priced ($14+ for a dinner entree). I gave a two star rating because it is mainly a bar, and that aspect of the place isn\\'t as bad. It\\'s a dive-like bar, but they pour strong drinks.\"\\n \\'This place is a joke. I went for oysters since I just started getting into them and I have to admit, this is the worst place for them. I ordered a few to try and tried to order something else off the menu but when I tried, it was like EVERYTHING was unavailable at the moment. How can you make money if you have nothing to sell? Ended up with 6 oysters and a burger. Waste of time and money.\\'\\n \"I was excited about trying this place but didn\\'t even make it inside.  The outside area smells like an ash tray and is filthy.  There\\'s a pot right outside the door filled with cigarette butts.   When I opened the door, the entry way was as bad, if not, worse than the outside.  It wreaked of cigarettes and filthy.  We turned around and left right away.  Let me know when the place is cleaned and I may be back.\"\\n \"Saw this place and decided to give it a try but didn\\'t make it past the front door.  There were cigarette butts all over the side walk,. We opened the door to a little room/ entryway area  and it smelled terrible like mildew, plus it was extremely dirty. For us that was a deal breaker and made us wonder what their kitchen must  look like.\"\\n \\'Their batter is way too heavy for the sesame beef and general tao chicken. As if they used too much corn starch maybe? In both cases you get these hard lumps that are partially air filled and barely have chicken/beef inside. The sauce for both is also way too sweet. The sweet sugary taste overwhelms any other taste. Shrimps in lobster sauce were extremely salty. It was overall just quite disappointing.\\'\\n \"Health nuts (and those looking for lighter fare) will love that the food is free of heavy seasonings. But the portions are tiny and, my God, is the service here slow and rude. Perhaps that\\'s why Sushi San, despite occupying one of the most visible spots in the food court, attracts hardly any customers even during peak hours. Once I asked for rice and vegetables in separate containers (as opposed to one on top of the other in a cramped bowl, making it impossible to enjoy the two together). The server flatout refused without even a trivial apology.\"\\n \\'The Good:\\\\nSO and I both ordered Unagi bowls. The unagi itself was good, and that\\\\\\'s the only reason I gave this two stars instead of one. \\\\nThe Bad:\\\\nThe veggies served with it were not great, and it did not come with miso soup, unlike all of their other \"bowls\". Also, it took an extremely long time to receive our relatively simple meals, around fifteen-twenty minutes. This was because he completely forgot about us and only remembered when my SO went up and to ask about the food. Moreover, he and I watched as the worker (probably also the manager) argued with a customer, saying that she had already received her food, when it was clear it was a different girl who happened to order the same item. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, would not return, especially with Sushi Ichiban so close, and with more reasonable prices.\\'\\n \\'this was not yummy or freshish or really ok. but if you insist on a california roll and happen to be trapped in the illini union at the time, how bad could it be?\\'\\n \\'I did not enjoy my experience here. My boyfriend and I were kind of excited to see that their nachos come topped with bacon. When the waitress (finally) came by to ask how everything was, I asked her if there was supposed to be bacon and she simply said \"yes it\\\\\\'s small\".. it was just lackluster service and food quality.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s a get-what-you-pay-for experience, I guess. It\\\\\\'s close to the Bell Centre, but so are other places that will have better food and service. The only thing I really liked was that you can have free popcorn... that\\\\\\'s pretty fun :)\\'\\n \"It\\'s a sports bar, but that doesn\\'t mean the staff have to be half-a**ed and not give a s**t.\\\\n\\\\nOur server was rude right up to the point where my girlfriend spoke French. It\\'s Montreal, don\\'t pretend like this is the first time you\\'ve had people speaking English. This is located in a touristy area (Bell Centre, Train Station nearby...).\\\\n\\\\nThe nachos are supposed to have bacon on them. Ours didn\\'t seem to have any, so we asked. We shouldn\\'t have bothered asking - we were treated like idiots for asking. We eventually found a few crumbs of bacon. Don\\'t describe the dish on the menu with bacon then have brush us off because we couldn\\'t find any.\\\\n\\\\nScratch that - we found two chips with hints of bacon.\\\\n\\\\nThanks for the free popcorn...that was the highlight. \\\\n\\\\nAgain, this is just a sports bar and not a good one. Go elsewhere. This place gets business because it is a chain and has a notable name. \\\\n\\\\nI guess the beer was cold...they got that right.\"\\n \\'The Cage aux Sports is to Quebec - what Hooters is to the Southern US. They are everywhere, the menu is the same and they are boring.\\\\n\\\\nI had gone for lunch and wanted to order the hot-chicken sandwich. Was politely told by the waitress that they didn\\\\\\'t have any bread to make the sandwich. HUH? I\\\\\\'m no chef, but when I suggested that they substitute it for a hamburger bun and that I would be happy with that - she said the cook won\\\\\\'t want to switch.\\\\n\\\\nSo I ordered a burger because they had a new menu with some \"specialty\" burgers. The patty was not fresh - it was the variety that you take from the freezer. Probably with grill marks already produced on them. It was not an enjoyable meal. \\\\n\\\\nA friend of mine had the grilled chicken wrap - commented that it was alright also.\\\\n\\\\nAnother friend of mine had the roasted chicken breast - said it was great, nice and moist chicken.\\\\n\\\\nJust goes to prove to you - stick with the old.\\'\\n \\'Breakfast!!\\\\n\\\\nNothing to WOW about.\\\\nAlthough their Specialty Pancakes look impressive as hell.\\\\nThere is a Notice that these meals (even omelettes) may require an 18min cooking time over your basic bacon and eggs. Just an fyi.\\\\n\\\\nParty of one. No counter to kick back at. Bummer.\\\\nGreat service though. They are all over you, and very nice. Monica was a sweetheart.\\\\nEspecially with what the servers are contending with......and you too if you come here.\\\\n\\\\nTuesday morning 10:00am. Waited only 5mins for my table.\\\\nOnce seated I\\\\\\'m surrounded by a couple screaming kids, several folks (who remember phonebooths)  chatting away about taking their garbage cans out, or having been to Phoenix already, etc., LOUDLY.\\\\nAll the while ingnoring those right in front of them? I\\\\\\'m finding it sad that older people have discovered public use of a cell phone too. They make loud speaking people louder.\\\\n\\\\nFood is certainly worthy here. Except maybe the $3 small orange juice. Maybe even the $15 total which includes a $2 tip. And can most certainly get higher. I had a simple breakfast.\\\\n\\\\nWill I come again? Probably not as a party of one. With my folks, or a \"morning after\" episode of a fine romance? Majority rules will have to win that one.\\\\n\\\\nGive me the Mom & Pop breakfast joint any ol\\\\\\' time versus a place like this or similar.\\\\n\\\\nBut, your mileage may vary. I don\\\\\\'t even want to think about a Sunday!\\'\\n \"S\\'il est vrai que pour moi l\\'ambiance d\\'un restaurant est importante, très même, à quoi peut servir une belle déco et une vue imprenable sur le tarmac et sur les avions (hey pour ceux qui comme moi adorent l\\'aviation c\\'est génial), si la nourriture est moyenne?\\\\nCe restaurant est un vrai «attrape touriste» alors un conseil: Mangez AVANT d\\'entrer dans la zone réglementé, mangez chez vous, ou encore... attendez sagement votre repas d\\'avion.... c\\'est à peu près pareil!\"\\n \"Si j\\'étais vous j\\'éviterais.

We asked for small plates to share as he was passing over the food to us. The waiter smiled like a creep and said \"Do I have four hands?\" \\\\nIs this guy FOR REAL?

The price is high.\\'\\n \"AVOID!!!!!\\\\n\\\\nMyself and a friend had dinner here, he ordered off the breakfast menu (ham and eggs) and I ordered the fish and chips. \\\\n\\\\nService was slow to non-existent. meals were served without any cutlery and when I requested some, only I was supplied with any, my friend had to ask seperatly and wait even longer.\\\\n\\\\nFood quality was terrible, the ham was poor quality and over cooked and while the fish wasn\\'t as bad the batter wasn\\'t quite restaurant quality.\\\\n\\\\nThat was the end of my dealings with Gabby but my friend went back the next morning to give it another chance.

Food and sides are dry and lack seasoning. The owner is also rude and not very friendly. Do Not buy from this place.\\'\\n \"The food is old, dry, and has no taste whatsoever. I work in the hospital. I have given this place several chances, and every time I come here I am incredibly disappointed with the food. The butter chicken has no flavour. I don\\'t usually add salt to my meals. However, I had to add THREE packages of salt to my meal. That is crazy! The chicken legs looks incredibly dry due to sitting under the heat lamps all day. They should not appear to have wrinkles on the skin. My colleagues have bought the chicken legs for lunch, and the meat was stringy--not normal for chicken legs.\\\\n\\\\nI was ordering 1/2 fries and 1/2 onion rings. Unfortunately, they no longer sell them this way. You would have to buy a side of fries and a side of onion rings. Therefore, they have lost my business forever.\\\\n\\\\nThe owners are fortunate that they get unsuspecting and new customers each day because it is a hospital. If their business were based on returning customers, they would go bankrupt very quickly. Also look at the lineups. There\\'s lineups at Subway, Hero Burger, and Druxy\\'s. The staff knows not to eat there because they know that the food is horrible.\"\\n \\'The food is dry and not fresh at all..everyone I know in the hospital knows this..but due to lack of choices still end up buying here. Last time I purchased the butter chicken and the chicken was stringy falling off the bone. Even the bone was mushey! Yuck! Had to toss it in the garbage after one bite.

I have never been before, and at this point I never will again. I ordered take out. Lasagna, a child size gnocchi, and chicken and rice soup. I ordered these based on what I found online. Basically good reviews. The lasagna was 5 layers of noodles, meaning noodle on top of noodle, under the 5 layers of noodles..yes, just noodles, was a thin layer of ricotta and another noodle. Nothing between the layers of just noodles, not even sauce. On top was some cheese baked golden brown, deceiving. The menu states meat sauce, 2 little flecks of meat is what I am looking at. I took 2 bites, and I stopped eating it. I went back to the kitchen to check the rest, thinking maybe I just got the end piece and the filling fell out. No. Next I try the gnocchi, chewy is an understatement. They were also hard. Not to confuse the al dente of the lasagna. This dish had one tiny piece of meat visible in the sauce. Smaller than a grain of rice. I didn\\'t even try the chicken and rice soup yet, as I was so disappointed. I have never returned food, or even complained. I was hungry, and disappointed. I just called the place, and the women who answered told me I really should have called last night when I ordered. I picked up at 840p-845p. They close at 10. I should have called last night, because she can\\'t do anything for me now. I don\\'t want you to do anything for me, I wanted to express my opinion (something I never do) on how this food is not even edible. I was told I could call tomorrow when the boss (who I believe may be the cook) is in, but she can\\'t do anything for me. Again, I stated I didn\\'t want anything. I was told no one else ever complained about the lasagna. I said, according to what I found online (however most reviews are older) that is exactly why I ordered it, as I was thinking the same. The women up front were nice last night, today on the phone wasn\\'t exactly the same. I am unsure if she just thought I was trying to get my items for free, or what the case was. I am debating on even heating up the soup but, I guess I should at least give it a try.\"\\n \\'I went yesterday with my family \\\\nBecause my father who lives near told us that M Patate has the best fries ever .\\\\nDeception when we all ordered \"poutine\"\\\\nOne Italian sauce \\\\nThe young guy started it ,but suddenly went to his break ,the boss took his place ,\" horror\"\\\\nHe went cheap on it \\\\nPutting very little cheese and sauce \\\\nAnd the plastic dish was not full....\\\\nWe were very dissatisfied with that \\\\nI don\\\\\\'t know if I will return \\\\nThere are so many other places near who are exceptionnel \\\\n( Pizzeria Varennes ,Welat Pizza, cantine style )\\\\nThe only positive thing in our visit was that it was really clean \\\\nBut the \" boss\" should have made an effort for us ,new costumers \\\\nThat\\\\\\'s the way to bring people \\\\nLinda\\'\\n \\'The Office is permanently closed. New business in same location is now V. Picasso, an upscale tapas bar owned by Victor Fuentes, which opened October 6, 2009.\\'\\n \\'I really wanted to like this place, but had a bad experience. \\\\n\\\\n1st time I went - I ordered nachos and they came with \"squeeze cheese\" mixed with shredded cheese. They were okay nachos, but slightly disappointing with the squeeze cheese...Next time I went, I requested only shredded cheese and had the squeeze cheese on the side in case I felt like dipping. As I was sitting at the bar munching, a cockroach crawled across the bar...I am having a difficult time getting that memory out of my head and have not gone back since!\\'\\n \"I just heard The Office closed it\\'s doors for good - shocking...\"\\n \\'Tail gators.. tail gaters.. whatever, just a gimmick. I sit down around 8pm, it seemed that they were running some kind of Ohio state b-ball special.  Because patrons either had been there a long time, or have super low tolerances.  I sat down at the corner of the bar. Open seats to the left and the right.  It took  10 minutes to be acknowledged (note: 2 bartenders, 10 to 11 people at the bar). Now it was probably 5 minute because I was particularly parched.  The general feeling was not friendly during the entire stay.  Felt like they tend to regulars.  I ordered the calzone.  For the price, this was a hell of a deal.  As far as taste it was better than the price.  I will not say the flavor was something great, but it was border line epic in size.  Service was average after they realized I was going to stay and get food.  Overall this is an ok place to get food but nothing special.  Plenty of room, and plenty of large good quality Tvs to watch.\\\\n\\\\nWould I go there again... yeah but I would need a hankering for it.  Yah I said hankering.  Side note: sometimes they have live bands.\\\\n2.5 stars if I could.\\'\\n \\'Well I am thinking it was this place in 2003. Our friends took us here for a good time. What a disaster. There were cars on the ceiling and all around. I remember that the food was absolutely horrendous. Not just is was ridiculously bad. I really am trying to find out whether this is the name of this place. I remember walking outside after in between big buildings or walls or something. I also remembered how our friends could take us to such a crappy place when there are so many half decent recents to eat. As Doctor Phil would say \" what were they thinking?\" . Any help appreciated. I need to post this place or whatever the name of it was  on my top 10 or top 5 worst meals ever . It was that bad. I would not even give it a 1/5 if was like  -5.\\'\\n \\'15 miles from the Las Vegas strip this place claims to have Iowa Pork Tenderloin Sandwiches and since it\\\\\\'s been more than 5 years \\\\nsince we had one we were determined to make the drive. When we arrived it looked very promising a large crowd was gathering next door for the car show and once we entered the place had a very cool atmosphere with \\\\nTV\\\\\\'s on every wall,classic 50\\\\\\'s \\\\nboothes and all kinds of car memorabilia. Plus \\\\ntheres a bar & game room upstairs. There was no wait & plenty of seating when we arrived at 6:00 pm. After we were seated , 20 minutes later a teenage waitress came to take our drink order, 20 minutes later she came back with the drinks and took our order. We ordered 4 sliders,Fried Cheese, Pork Tenderloin & Country Fried Steak Sandwiches. A little pricier than the menu we had found on the \\\\ninterent but still fairly reasonable. While we waited for our appetizer we saw several disgruntled patrons complaining about the slow service & leaving. After an hour of waiting we still had NOT seen our waitress for a refill or explanation. There were at most 30-40 patrons in the place at this time. The people sitting across from us had to have waited 20 minutes for there bill and finally a \\\\nwaitress brought them every unpaid check and asked which one was theirs, the man left exact cash for the check & voiced quite loudly to no one in particular he wasn\\\\\\'t leaving any damn tip-for what? On 2 \\\\noccasions while we were waiting with our EMPTY glasses on the edge of the table as a CLEAR sign we needed MORE to drink the waitresses would turn tail and run before they made eye contact and had to DO THEIR JOB!! Finally fed up with waiting for NO APPARENT REASON we decided to give up and go somewhere that actually serves their customers. We approached the waitress to find out what the problem was she laughed & said \"it\\\\\\'s crazy in here\" with no apology or explanation for the ABSURDLY long wait. HELL we\\\\\\'ve waited an HOUR to get into a place with NO problem but an HOUR to see your waitress after you\\\\\\'ve ordered-NEVER and we eat out 3-4 times a week! To say it was BAD service is an understatement. We never had a chance to try any of the food but without a doubt there was NO way it would have been good enough to compensate for the \\\\natrocious service. The only way I would recommend this place is if it were FREE & they were POURING booze down your throat while you wait. IF you are looking for a disrespectful smart mouthed teenager to give you SHIT this is your kind of place. BUT if you expect to get what your paying for Quality Food & Service you MOST definitely will NOT find it here.\\'\\n \\'Meh. First time at this chain. It was alright, I guess. The cashier seemed to hate her life. My gyro was just okay. The Texan Fries, or whatever the side dish is called, were incredibly bland and disappointing.\\'\\n \\'Negative 1 star. First time ever at a Mr. Hero. Smelled if grease upon entrance and food was just as bad. Gross.\\'\\n \\'Typical food, but watch out for overcharging. They charge full price for sandwich, not the special, if you add the more meat option\\'\\n \\'Great place. Order food 11/2 later nothing thanks to grub hub. Call and im told oh this happens all the time with them. So why use a company that treats your customers like this. \\\\n\\\\nSo another chance 24.00 for 2 subs. Ordered no lettuce no tomato. Guess what nothing they can do. Sorry. This world os done you irresponsible snowflakes want 15.00 an hour and can not take and order. Your manager and owner will not take responsibility. Know why it happens starts ftom the top down. Same non American owner in Kent does the same thing same policy. Nice to know. Anybody spends a dime here you get what they want not what you order. This has happened multiple times im lied to we will handle it. NEVER AGAIN.\\'\\n \\'Great place. Order food 11/2 later nothing thanks to grub hub. Call and im told oh this happens all the time with them. So why use a company that treats your customers like this. By to you too\\'\\n \\'Any restaurant, and yes they have tables for eat in at this location, having signs,  on the front door and on what may be a restroom door, specifically stating \"No Public Restroom\"... Now first of all this is probably in violation of Ohio law, but what about courtesy to customers?  First and last time.. indicates not customer friendly.  Food is just average.\\'\\n \"I tried to call and place an order, the person who answered the phone didn\\'t speak any English and decided to hang up on me! Horrible way to run a business!! No wonder they are never busy! And their tiramisu is HORRENDOUS!!!\"\\n \"well, maybe it was the  time I went or what I had but I would have to give them about the same rating as I would give red lobster. I can\\'t understand how anyone could like Red lobster if you know what good seafood is.I was born and grew up with family from Baltimore Maryland where good seafood is what the city is about.I was excited to try it as I love seafood but my food just was not good. I can\\'t say my service was all the great either. I would not go again\"\\n \\'I am a complete fish lover.  Growing up that was my staple -- fish, all kinds of seafood, octopus, lobster, crab...I think you get the idea.\\\\n\\\\nI had passed this place on the way home one night and vowed to see what it was about.  I checked out their website -- not too shabby!\\\\n\\\\nHubby and I decided to give it a go the other night.\\\\n\\\\nWhat a disappointment.  I can\\\\\\'t even articulate about how overcooked my food was or how meagre the service was.  I practically begged for water and silverware.\\\\n\\\\nWords cannot describe how angry I felt when I left.  The food, the service, utterly disappointing.\\\\n\\\\nI ordered their Cedar Plank Salmon.  The salmon was so overdone that the edges were past the point of crisp -- they were burnt.  I asked our server if I could please get one that was not quite so charred.  I swear she rolled her eyes at me.\\\\n\\\\nThe sides were the only highlight of that meal.  Hubby\\\\\\'s meal was \"ok\" by his standards, but I could see a stream of resentment building in him.\\\\n\\\\nIt was a Thursday night, not too packed, but busy enough.  Our server was more concerned with her chatter with the other servers.  It\\\\\\'s one thing to have friends at work, but you don\\\\\\'t neglect the customer.  I saw that we were not the only ones who bore the brunt of her bad service.\\\\n\\\\nWhen my plate came back, she slammed the dish down so hard that the salmon almost fell onto the table.\\\\n\\\\nSurly much?\\\\n\\\\nI can\\\\\\'t give this place a good recommendation.  Their beer selection was ho hum as was their mixed drinks.\\\\n\\\\nNot a place I would recommend for friends or out of towners.\\'\\n \"Well I sat down and I was told I\\'d be waited on momentarily. The blonde bartender who said that proceeded to wait on everybody else but me so after about 15 minutes of sitting there with no service I decided to leave. Won\\'t be back.\"\\n \"Went to a family event at Fuddruckers this week. Have a relative who digs it. Going there just gives me the willies. \\\\n\\\\nIt definitely seems to have been cleaned up a bit from the last time we went. It was dirty, nasty the previous time. Little bit of solace in that. DIdn\\'t seem as dirty. They\\'d reupholstered the booths with the torn vinyl. They\\'d gotten rid of the cracked & torn vinyl red & white striped tablecloths. Still cracked & old formica but it didn\\'t seem as dirty.\\\\n\\\\nAs far as the food, I got a bacon cheeseburger that was just not very good. Ok, but nothing special at all. The fries weren\\'t great either. In years past, I was a big fan of the plastic cheese in the heated cheese fountain but not so much either. After it cools a bit, it\\'s just nasty.\\\\n\\\\nI will go back when future family events require & maybe with less trepidation but I still wouldn\\'t go there by choice with other good options nearby.\"\\n \\'Apparently the original name was Fuckrudder\\\\\\'s but for some reason that didn\\\\\\'t take off. So a few multi million dollar advertising meetings later, waaa laa, Fuddrucker\\\\\\'s. Ahhh, c\\\\\\'mon, it\\\\\\'s still fun to say. Now, is it fun to eat here? Well, back in it\\\\\\'s hey day, I thought it was pretty fun. Design your own burger. Grab a beer. Chow down. However, the last time I ate at Fuddrucker\\\\\\'s, it was a sad sight. The \"burger bar\" was a disaster. Nothing really interesting for toppings. Except for the artificial nacho cheese sauce perhaps. And what was there was picked over like the last bologna wrapped pickle at a trailer park picnic. And speaking of trailer parks, even though this particular Fuckrudder\\\\\\'s, ooops, er um, I mean Fuddrucker\\\\\\'s is in tony Scottsdale, the clientele was, was, well they scared me.\\'\\n \\'I get my hair cut next door to this place and have thought about eating there a few times after I noticed their sign that says, \"Home of the best Cuban Sandwich in Charlotte,\" and finally did this afternoon after reading a couple of positive reviews about the place.\\\\n\\\\nI have to say I was disappointed.\\\\n\\\\nI have had a lot of Cuban sandwiches in my time, and have even gone so far as to roast my own pork, go to Compare\\\\\\'s Foods for Cuban bread, and making my own (I\\\\\\'m a culinary student).  The sandwich at Carolina Grill has all the components -- the ham, the pork, the cheese, the mustard, pickle and Cuban bread -- but nothing was really very special.  My idea of a good Cuban has a meaty, chewiness to it -- thick slices of home-roasted pork, slices of good ham.\\\\n\\\\nThe \"roast pork\" here was, as the last reviewer said, some kind of pulled pork and not sliced.  In fact, it looked and tasted suspiciously like a commercial product of Carolina-style barbecue pork.  I noticed they have both \"Cuban Roast Pork\" and Barbecue Sandwiches on the menu, which makes me wonder maybe they started out using sliced roast pork and they switched to the barbecue.  The restaurant seemed a bit slow, and when places start cutting food costs because of that it is a vicious downhill cycle that leads to no good.  The ham also didn\\\\\\'t impress -- the best Cubans I\\\\\\'ve had have ham that was cut from a chunk, like Honey Ham.  This place uses thin processed ham -- like the Danish baked ham that comes in rectangular plastic packages hanging next to the Oscar Meyers.  \\\\n\\\\nI also had an appetizer of Ham Croquettes that were a frozen commercial product.  It wasn\\\\\\'t bad, but I\\\\\\'d suggest the \"chef straight from Cuba,\" as one of the co-owners described, keep the box low so diners can\\\\\\'t see it from the dining room.  Something like that tells me a lot about a place.  The chef has nothing to do in the afternoon slow period, but instead of making a batch of home-made croquettes from scratch to freeze (probably saving food cost too) he uses a commercial frozen product.\\\\n\\\\nI think this place has the potential to be a good spot with home-made Cuban food, but they need to commit to making the food from scratch as much as possible instead of cutting corners with commercial products whenever they can.  And if they really want to push their Cuban Sandwich as the best (not a bad ideal at all), then they need to make it the best, starting with roasting the pork and using good ham.  More pickles woudn\\\\\\'t hurt either.\\'\\n \"2016-12-11 Food is ok. Service sucks! I had to wait to order take out while they took three phone orders! I used to order from here all the time. They\\'ve lost my business. Red Rose Garden (down the street) has way better service.\"\\n \"I tried their food yesterday after someone recommended it. It was by far the most disgusting Chinese food I\\'ve ever eaten in my life! The food tasted rotten and fishy, the chicken was slimy and didn\\'t even tasty like the dish it was supposed to be. My husband and I ordered different dishes and we couldn\\'t tell the difference between them. They both had the exact same flavor and both tasted equally nasty! My teenage son took a few bites and wouldn\\'t eat it and that says a lot!\\\\nWhat a waste of money!! Never again! I would have given it zero stars but it insisted I give at least one.\"\\n \\'We have been a long time customer here. Unfortunately, the Quality & portion sizes have seemed to go down over the years and prices have increased. With many other options for Asian cuisine in the area, we will be looking elsewhere from now on.\\'\\n \\'The sodexo located at wells fargo on price has a lot to be desired.

Ceviche was decent but mostly onions and small for $25, and the other dish was basically cold soggy fries and red peppers with a small number of very chewy and very small bits of beef. I ate two bites and left it, only earring the side of rice with the ceviche. They discounted the $16 dish by $6. Ended up being over $40. Never again.\\'\\n \"The chicken Caesar salad - if you want a healthy tasty lunch in uptown charlotte NC - run - don\\'t walk as far away as you can from this restaurant -  I had lunch there at 12 :30 today, they make the salad up early to handle the lunch rush so the  salad had been sitting in dressing for some time - so the only crisp was from the over abundance of stalks in the mix.  The chicken which apparently had been sitting in water was soggy and unappealing.  The Caesar dressing might have a good flavor but was so dilouted with water that it poured more like a vinaigrette rather than a caesar - and no it was not  caesar vinaigrette - there was one item in the salad with flavor and crunch, that was the croutons - the greasy fat soaked croutons.  So greasy they left grease stains on the napkin.  The salad also came with two packs of Captains Crackers - easily the best part of the whole lunch.  Not good not even close.\"\\n \"My wife and I ate here for breakfast one morning after about two weeks of living in Stoughton. The experience wasn\\'t what I would call the best. The waitress was one of those annoyed old school types that scoffs if you ask the wrong question; like anything to do with gluten, egg whites or asking for a substitution. We also got weird looks when we asked for a plain egg scrambled for our 14 month old son. We had brought in some fruit for him as well and she eyed us like we were stealing from them. The food was average, not great and the restaurant was full of what I can only describe as peaked, backwoods Arkansas types. Basically rednecks in cut off shirts with too much body mass and too many kids screaming throughout the meal. Definitely not coming back.\"\\n \\'You could not pay me to eat here again!\\\\n\\\\nThe menu is easily over 50 items long and the service is just ok. It is definitely geared more for older folks you like there food bland and mushy. There really is nothing special about this place.\\'\\n \"When we first moved to stoughton we stopped in. It took 20 minutes to get coffee and when we got our food it was luke warm and disgusting (breakfast and it  was a chickem fried steak special) we\\'ve never returned.\"\\n \"I just had a surprising and incredibly disappointing experience at one of my (formerly) favorite breakfast restaurants, the Sunrise Family Restaurant in Stoughton. The owner/cook humiliated my friend and I for sending food back that was way over-cooked (and not what we\\'d asked for). We (and the poor wait staff) were horrified when he screamed at me from the kitchen for wasting his food and refused to honor the order. The worst part - multiple people there who know the owner told us that had a man been at our table it would either have been done right the first time or fixed without complaint.\\\\n\\\\nI was on my way to becoming a regular - I\\'ve been there at least a half dozen times in the past 8-10 weeks. I was with my friend who has been going there at least twice a week for over two years.

After calling for 20 minutes straight and no answer, I figured I would do my first yelp review since they do not want to here from me.\\\\nThe one thing you can count on from this chain is being disappointed.\\\\nI recommend the Jack in the Box a little west, or the Whataburger on 43rd and Bell. At least it\\'s eatable.\"\\n \\'This review is about the employees, not the food, didn\\\\\\'t get to have any..\\\\n\\\\nI came to this Carl\\\\\\'s Jr after driving straight through from San Diego. I also drove 20 extra minutes from my hotel to come here.. I had double checked the hours (closed at 2 am), and debated if I even wanted to go out of my way for food. \\\\nOn Monday night, October 30th, at 1:30 am, I arrived at this Carl\\\\\\'s Jr. As I was driving up, I noticed a car reversing out of the drive though... uh-oh. \\\\nI am a human being. I can completely understand that on a Monday night it would be dead. Not having any customers for hours, and the employees decide to close early and go home. I get it, not cool, but I get it. \\\\nI was pretty upset that night though, as you could probably understand. I was going to leave a note so the openers knew that they had lost money by closing early. (Not that that was the best decision, but this is the story.) I was going to wedge it in the drive through window; as I touched it, it slid open about a half inch, even though it was still locked.\\\\nThis noise, then prompted the employees, hiding in the back, to come see what it was. THE EMPLOYEES WERE THERE THE WHOLE TIME. The lights were off, they hadn\\\\\\'t answered the phone when I called prior to coming, and they said nothing at the drive through intercom. They were shocked to see me standing outside my car. I held up my note for them, which called them lazy, and said something to the effect of \"I just want some food\". They proceeded to laugh at me. Well, I got one of them in a photo. \\\\n\\\\nTo consumers reading this, I don\\\\\\'t know what to tell you. Just don\\\\\\'t hit this location after midnight I guess. I imagine this wasn\\\\\\'t the first time, and won\\\\\\'t be the last if they stay employeed here..\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s one thing to close early and go home, but to close early and just sit around at work in the dark?? Pathetic. And laugh at someone who is clearly hangry?! ... smh\\\\n\\\\nTo those girls, go apply at a place that closes at 8pm.. \\\\n\\\\nFor the manager to help identify them:\\\\nThe employees were presumably two females. The one who was able to dodge the photo was young, dark hair, with shorter hair in a pony tail, and shorter than 5\\\\\\'6\", and wearing make up. The one in the photo seemed to have a natural look, and also had dark hair. She seemed taller than the other girl. \\\\n\\\\nSo to the manager here, your employees are taking advantage of you.\\'\\n \"This is really the tale of two bars.  \\\\n\\\\nThe positive is that drinks are cheap and the food is pretty good.  I\\'ve had few things in my stops there and I haven\\'t been disappointed by food yet.  The wings are fantastic, the sandwhichs are filling, and the sides are tasty.  \\\\n\\\\nI go here when i\\'m waiting my girlfriend to get home from work on mondays and the bartender monday sucks running.  She can\\'t focus on more than one task at once and therefore is constantly flustered which makes for an uncomfortable air in the bar area. I\\'ve witnessed one of her meltdowns actually clear a pretty full bar.  Dear owner, this trainwreck is costing you money...you might want to consider upgrading staff.\\\\n\\\\nThe times she hasn\\'t been there and a capable staffmember has been working has produced fun experiences.  That said, given the location it is what it is:  a yinzer bar bordering a less than desireable area of town and has everything that comes with it.\"\\n \"Icky and SMOKEY! I know they\\'re technically following the law by allowing smoking in their bar, but there is NO divider and the WHOLE PLACE smells like smoke. Had we not taken someone else there, I would have walked out the second I walked in... The food was decent, but unless you want to breathe in carcinogens the whole time you dine, stay...\"\\n \"Seems like the bartenders aren\\'t interested in creating a good environment in the workplace.  Maybe that\\'s why there is 5 people in the bar on a Saturday night. Good food.  Might be time for a new happier staff.\"\\n \"Bears living in the zoo eat fresher and higher quality food than this. \\\\n\\\\nI was saddened at how horrific this geriatric hot spot was, and I\\'m definitely not surprised that this place is now closed. \\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately I made the decision to try this place out. I have no idea why. \\\\n\\\\nMy friend ordered a sandwich. That\\'s pretty much all there is to say about it. He ordered a sandwich, ate it, and he immediately regretted it. \\\\n\\\\nI made the poor choice to select the unimpressive and soggy chicken alfredo pasta. It looked as though it had come from a can, a freshly opened can nonetheless, hence the one star. I couldn\\'t eat it without the gag reflex setting in. \\\\n\\\\nThe interior made me feel strange and awkward with wooden bear figurines, bad seating, fake foliage, doily tablecloths and hanging needlepoint pictures.\\\\n\\\\nWell Quilted Bear, if anything, you left a strong impression in my mind as well as some comic relief every now and then when I drive by your outdated sign--still wondering what heck possessed me to walk though those disgusting doors. RIP, Quilted Bear.\"\\n \"Is your name Onita? \\\\nNo?\\\\n\\\\nDo you like wicker chairs?\\\\nNo?\\\\n\\\\nDo you like fake ivy?\\\\nNo?\\\\n\\\\nThen you really shouldn\\'t go to the Quilted Bear. It smells like old people. Honestly, I can\\'t even remember what I got. Maybe a chicken salad sandwich. \\\\nI was so overwhelmed by the 70+ average age, the wicker chairs and fake dusty ivy everywhere that I couldn\\'t hardly stand it.\"\\n \\'tried to go on friday night but it was closed. looks like they were booted by the landlords\\'\\n \\'While the place has an original menu, everything they serve ends up tasting the same in my opinion.  Perhaps it is because they offer only 2 bread choices, or in their way of cooking, but I just was not impressed by their sandwiches.  \\\\nI had their standard fries as well, and they used a seasoning that was not very complimentary to the sauces they served on the side.  I did enjoy the kettle chips that were included with the sandwich, but for nearly $10 a pop, I expect a bit more from a sandwich.\\'\\n \"The most meh food you can buy. Management is horrible don\\'t waste your Money if I could give 0 stars I would.\"\\n \"Rockne\\'s is one of our stops when visiting Kent State. We have never been disappointed until now ... I ordered a fish hoagie and it seemed as if it was frozen and not freshly breaded. Our server\\'s attentiveness certainly made up for the hoagie.  We will probably visit again...just not order the fish.\"\\n \\'We ordered through the online service Just Eat. The order was for a combination dinner of won ton soup, orange beef, spicy peanut butter chicken, big shrimp with vegetables and spring rolls.\\\\n\\\\nThe order showed up exactly at the promised time.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, all of the food was luke warm and had to be reheated in the microwave.\\\\n\\\\nThe won ton soup had a plain broth - not very tasteful but the won tons themselves were good.\\\\n\\\\nThe spring rolls were excellent and were highlights of the meal.\\\\n\\\\nThe orange beef lacked any crispness even before being reheated and was in a dark brown sweet sauce that lacked any orange flavor.\\\\n\\\\nThe chicken fried rice was very dry and needed sauce from one or more of the other dishes to be edible.\\\\n\\\\nthe big shrimp and vegetables was very good. Decent sized shrimp and stir fried vegetables that were fresh and were flavorful.\\\\n\\\\nThe chicken in spicy peanut butter sauce was the mystery dish or the night. I think it was another dish altogether. The thinly sliced chicken was tender but the sauce was orange colored and greasy and there was nothing resembling peanut butter or spice (see photo).\\\\n\\\\nThere are many Asian restaurants on that particular drop of Decarie Boulevard. I would suggest trying any one of the others.\\'\\n \"We used to go there to order chinese food because it was the best and only option compared to the other chinese restaurants in the neighborhood. Although I am never going back, last time we only asked to the cashiere how long would it take for an order to be ready for a take out and she went to ask I\\'m guessing the manager... He came back literally yelling at us, telling us that it depends on the plates we order etc... He was so aggressive for no good reason, we ended up leaving really disappointed and promising ourselves not to go back.\"\\n \\'Sadly 1 star is the lowest i can give. I wish i could give in the negative. Anyway service is awful. They barely speak the language and take more than 1 and half hour to deliver. The food was cold and they still wanted us to pay full price for cold food.\\\\nPsd: the deliver was 8 minutes from the restaurant.\\'\\n \\'I had this place on my list but I didnt make in time because it is now closed.\\\\n\\\\nThe reviews here are varied and so are the ones elsewhere. Suppossedly thiey had deep fried hamburgers like Dyers in Memphis.\\\\n\\\\nSad to see it go but there must have been a reason\\'\\n \"Like another reviewer said, it does look like more from the outside.  When I walked in, it was actually a pretty shabby stand near the antique mall.  Prices weren\\'t bad I guess, but the burgers were very blah as well as the fries.  Definitely are much much better places to get a good burger than here.  I\\'ll give it one thing, it was all very fresh, as they didn\\'t make it till we ordered it.  Maybe a decent eat if you happen to be shopping at the antique mall, but don\\'t think we\\'ll be coming back just for the food!\"\\n \\'This place closed on April 30,2016. Guess it was killed by the dead\\\\nmall that surrounds it!\\'\\n \"Dear Mr. McGrath,\\\\n\\\\nI recognize you are a talented award winning chef. I love the Roaring Fork. However, I am wholehaeartedly dissapointed in what you\\'ve done to Pischke\\'s - its just not Pischke\\'s anymore at all. Pischke\\'s was a fun, friendly, unpretentious, comfort food joint. I loved hitting Pischke\\'s for lunch after a NASTY hangover. The single BEST SALAD ON THE PLANET was the Blackened Cajun Ceaser Salad and now its gone. Old Pischke\\'s would\\'ve gotten * * * * * five stars.\\\\n\\\\nNow it\\'s snobby and overpriced.\\\\n\\\\nBOTTOM LINE: Bring back my salad or else!!\"\\n \"I was a little dissapointed with the new Pischke\\'s. \\\\n\\\\nAdmittedly I was never a huge fan of the original, so maybe I\\'m not the most qualified to post the first review. \\\\n\\\\nThe menu was pretty limited. I had the mozzeralla and tomato sandwhich with soup. The soup was cold. The sandwhich was boring. \\\\n\\\\nMaybe I made a mistake by not going with the burger or pastrami sandwhich (both looked really good), but nothing I had made much of an impression. The service was nice, but overall the concept seemed pretty uninspired.\"\\n \"If it were not for the bloody mary and mimosa specials....there would be no reason to step foot in the new Pischkes (and still, I would rather go pay $7 for a mimosa where there is some atmosphere and good food. \\\\n\\\\nWhat a shame, this used to serve the best breakfast in town and have an hour wait....people enjoyed having a cocktail at the bar and running into friends....now, it is pretty much seat yourself and enjoy a limited menu.  HINT:  Mr. McGrath, bring back the old menu and food....I love the Roaring Fork and eat there twice a month, but this place used to be the best breakfast joint in town....bring back the old Pischke\\'s please!!!!\"\\n \"I can\\'t this is still listed.  PLACE HAS BEEN OUT OF BUSINESS FOR A YEAR.\"\\n \"I must agree with Scott S, but I should point out that I\\'m probably even less qualified to write a review of this place as I didn\\'t eat here... I merely wandered in and right back out. \\\\n\\\\nGone is the crowd and the long wait on a weekend morning waiting for a Pischke\\'s greasy and tasty breakfast. Gone is the kitschy decor that gave the place character. Gone are the sassy waitresses who looked like they needed a good night sleep. Gone are the bursting menus full of good eats at reasonable prices.\\\\n\\\\nReplacing all of this is a bland and boring decor, 50% fewer menu choices, and 50% higher prices. The place was pretty empty while every other breakfast place in the neighborhood (we drove past 5 others) was packed with a line going out the door. Here\\'s a tip for Mr Robert McGrath - if you buy a successful restaurant, don\\'t make drastic changes and jack up the prices... in other words - if it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'m actually kinda pissed too because I thought Pischke\\'s was pretty good and it was definitely adding character to our city... what\\'s there now is just another boring restaurant. There\\'s plenty of those around here... Pischke\\'s was unique to the area. When I visit my sister in Minnesota, she has some really neat breakfast places she takes me to that are decorated as an eclectic mess, but that blow you away with good greasy food and are dripping with atmosphere and fun. Same story when I go to San Diego or Long Beach to visit friends. Neat hip cities have neat hip breakfast joints. Well now we have one fewer. \\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s true - I haven\\'t eaten here and perhaps Robert McGrath makes the most bomb-ass bacon and eggs this side of the equator... but it would seriously have to blow my mind to put this place back on my list of places to go. The empty seats told me the story anyway. Before I left, I told the hostess to put it back the way it was. \\\\n\\\\nI plan to actually have a meal there sometime and then post a proper review... until then, this will have to do.\"\\n \"Edit: Since I reviewed this place, it has become something else and I can no longer recommend it. I\\'ll leave my original 4 star review in tact, but I\\'m taking away 2 of the stars to reflect the current state of the place - overpriced pretentiousness. I\\'m taking away one more star because they kept the name and ditched the no-brainer existing and working formula. My review of the new place is elsewhere here on Yelp. \\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s my original review of the original restaurant - sad to see it gone:\\\\n\\\\nFantastic breakfasts - a little on the greasy side, but it\\'s a neat little greasy spoon in old town Scottsdale. It belongs in Seattle or Minnesota really. It\\'s certainly a favorable alternative to a breakfast at The Breakfast Club. The staff isn\\'t quite as pretty (but so what?) and the food is a little bit more greasy (but it\\'s oh so good). You don\\'t have to get dressed up to go to breakfast like you do in some of the downtown scottsdale places which is nice. \\\\n\\\\nIt beats going to Denny\\'s and it\\'s reliable for some good food... you can\\'t go wrong here and the crowd is diverse and make for great people-watching. Sometimes it gets really busy, but the wait usually isn\\'t too bad.\"\\n \\'This place was perfect before it was \"upgraded\". It was a simple, kitschy, affordable, little place that had heart. It was a Scottsdale legend... Tragedy struck the family recently. So. Instead of preserving what locals had come to love (obvious if you ever tried to eat here on the weekends), Mr. McGrath instead \"upgraded\" and turned a remarkable place into just another old town restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nDon\\\\\\'t me wrong, the Roaring Fork is genius... but this place was as well....\\'\\n \\'Apparently Pischke\\\\\\'s used to be a fun, personality-filled destination for yummy brunch, which is why my friend Aaron guided us there one early afternoon.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, since Aaron\\\\\\'s last visit, changes have been made.\\\\n\\\\nNow Pischke\\\\\\'s is a bland eatery with a rather uninspired, limited menu positioned at the aspirational eating price point. As far as I can tell Pischke\\\\\\'s target customer is well off older people who are looking for unchallenging options and prices high enough to keep out the riff raff.\\\\n\\\\nPischke\\\\\\'s no longer serves daily brunch, so we had lunch on our visit. Among our group of six, not one of the dishes stood out in a positive way. The burger and salads were average. The crepes were decent but small and nothing special. The pork verde was fine, but inexplicably served with buttered flour tortillas. The pot pie was atrocious-- a \"deconstructed\" take on the typical comfort food it consisted of a large bowl filled with extremely bland pot pie filling, topped by a thin layer of philo dough flakes. It was devoid of everything (taste, crust) that makes a pot pie good.\\\\n\\\\nThe food was complimented by very poor service. Our waiter was totally smarmy and condescending, my drink order went unfilled, and when the food was served the waiter had coded the seats wrong so every single meal was placed in front of the wrong person.\\\\n\\\\nHighly unimpressive. While Phoenix may not be known as a fine dining destination, there are plenty of great restaurants in the area to patronize instead. Don\\\\\\'t waste your calories, time or money at Pischke\\\\\\'s.\\'\\n \\'Needs a new name - now.  \\\\n\\\\nThe Pischke\\\\\\'s of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath\\\\\\'s effort to keep \"Pischke\\\\\\'s\" alive.  But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke\\\\\\'s of old.  Call it \"The Blue Ribbon Cafe\" - take out the PIschke name - I can\\\\\\'t imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke\\\\\\'s Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.  \\\\n\\\\nThe current restaurant is not a laid back, family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious, and the food matches that.\\'\\n \\'The new \"Pischke\\\\\\'s Blue Ribbion\" is a cleaner, updated, reinvented \"Pischke\\\\\\'s\"... and it really blows! It is overpriced and boring!\\\\n\\\\nThere is NO POINT in keeping the \"Pischke\\\\\\'s\" name on this place whatsoever! I know tragedy struck this place once, and now it has again, with the complete disembowelment of what \"Pischke\\\\\\'s\" was all about! \\\\n\\\\nIt was a Scottsdale ledgend, it was a chill place to grab breakfast and work on the ol\\\\\\' hangover, it was actually perfect the way it was...\\\\n\\\\nToo bad.\\'\\n \\'I don\\\\\\'t understand the reviews of the restaurant.  Either we were on an off day or this restaurant won\\\\\\'t last another 30 days.  The food quality, service, management attentiveness was absolutley non-existent.  Some of the dishes could have been good if they were served hot and on time.  Service was horrendously slow and several of the dishes were inedible.  The Sea Bass was extremely salty, the Moroccan Chicken was cold and the medium rare lamb chops were well done.  \\\\nWe complained to the servers repeatedly and to the management with no positive results.  Management appears brain dead.  They had two responses: \"We\\\\\\'re sorry to hear that\" and \"We\\\\\\'re utilizing a new concept\" .\\'\\n \"Yelp has failed me...I went here based on the reviews I found on here, only to find a restaurant that has fallen off from what it used to be. \\\\n\\\\nI guess this use to be a chef driven restaurant, he created a name for the place. But whatever it is now it has definitely fallen off and definitely not good. \\\\n\\\\nThe space is nice enough, I really did not enjoy sitting at the bar and have to look at there dirty kitchen the whole time...But the place does offer a pleasant enough atmosphere. \\\\n\\\\nThe food on the other hand was bad. I had the tasting of the appetizers in which everything was overcooked (mushy eggplant) or overcooked and Burnt (anything that had bread like potential) I kinda of wanted to leave after this but I had ordered my Salmon entree from the start... \\\\n\\\\nAnd now on to the entree which consisted of overcooked salmon, burnt spices on the top, and RAW skin underneath, did not make any since to me. it came with a brick of polenta edible only by the pool of sauce on the plate. \\\\n\\\\nThe menu and idea of this restaurant is great, sharp contrasts and bold flavor, but the technique and care is definitely lack here, or maybe they just had a shitty cook that day, I don\\'t know, I just know that I will never make my way back there.\"\\n \"Hugely Disappointing!!  Based on all the other reviews maybe they were have an off night?  We already decided not to give it a 2nd try.....\\\\n\\\\nWe were seated and given menus but waited a good 10 minutes for them to come back for drink orders.  Then we waited a good 15 minutes for our dirty Kettle One martini\\'s to come and waiting to order.  While we were waiting as patiently as we could the waiter takes the full order (drinks, apps, meal) of the couple who were seated 15 minutes after we arrived! Of course I would be understanding on the wait if the place was packed but there were only 5 tables filled in the entire place!!\\\\n\\\\nWe finally ordered and the watier came back 3 different times to clarify what we ordered.\\\\n\\\\nThe complimentary bread finally arrived along with our drinks, which by the way were terrible and in filthy (spotty, lipstick stained, crusty).  The bread was really great though so I started to have hope.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the App\\'s the Scallop and Goat cheese was great- the duck and mushroom was bland.\\\\n\\\\nMain meal of pork chops and sea bass were boring. \\\\n\\\\nOh when we got the bill they only did Well Martini\\'s- would that have explained the poor taste or do they just not know how to make?\\\\n\\\\nBottom Line Summary:\\\\n\\\\nService Slow\\\\nWaiter Confused\\\\nMartini Horrible\\\\nDirty Dirty Glasses\\\\nFood sounds GREAT but tastes quite bland.\\\\n\\\\nVery Disappointing.\"\\n \\'Without a doubt the worst Chinese restaurant in Cleveland . The restaurant is located in an old McDonald\\\\\\'s building barely fitted for a sit down restaurant.  \\\\n\\\\nI ordered an egg roll - it was average - mustard and ketchup containers used for hot mustard and sweet and sour - cute. \\\\n\\\\nI ordered walnut chicken - a \"new\" menu item - it was horrible. I was expecting something fast fried in a brown sauce and stir fried with honey walnuts. What I received was a pile of \"white\" fried chicken with a flavorless sauce and some walnuts thrown in. It tasted like cornstarch -the sauce had absolutely no flavor - I would have added soy sauce, but I don\\\\\\'t need the extra sodium and there might not have been enough in the restaurant to spice it up.   \\\\n\\\\nThe service was extremely friendly and very attentive - so much so that I couldn\\\\\\'t bring myself to complain about the food.  I simply asked for a carryout container, boxed it up, and threw it out at my hotel.  \\\\n\\\\nIt was really cheap though - $15.00 for entree and egg roll.  I was on my expense account, so it didn\\\\\\'t bother me to go somewhere else to eat that night.  \\\\n\\\\nBut do yourself a favor - this place is not good.  Ignore the internet reviews.  I can\\\\\\'t believe that anything here has any flavor....\\'\\n \\'Not trying to rain on anyone\\\\\\'s parade. There just aren\\\\\\'t any choices here if you\\\\\\'re vegetarian or vegan. Well. There\\\\\\'s one. And you have to ask for no pork. And then the little guy (who was VERY nice by the way) asked if I ate no meat and when I said yes he said \"I\\\\\\'ll ask them to cook it in water because there is beef in the broth.\" ?? Okay. The sauce was super salty, not spicy like on the menu, and the tofu was very slimy. Anyway, it wasn\\\\\\'t great. But I ate it.\\'\\n \\'It\\\\\\'s amazing how things can go so wrong.\\\\n\\\\nOn a 9 a.m. visit, the first thing I noticed was that this shop offers soups, sandwiches, and salads.  I wasn\\\\\\'t in the mood for typical breakfast items. I asked the attendant whether they were serving sandwiches.  I even pointed to sandwiches on the menu.  No, he replied, only breakfast items (bacon, sausage, or ham and egg croissants or bagels).\\\\n\\\\nYou can\\\\\\'t nuke a croissant.  My $4 croissant was no better than a cheap Jimmy Dean frozen sausage croissant from the grocery store. It came with coffee that was nothing special. I pumped the coffee from dispensers that ran dry.  You get better coffee from 7-Eleven.\\\\n\\\\nI noticed servers standing around the soup and salad area.  Out of curiosity, I asked if they were serving soup and sandwiches.  Yes, they serve soup, salad, and sandwiches all day.\\\\n\\\\nI asked the attendant who helped me at first.  \"I thought you said you weren\\\\\\'t serving sandwiches.\"\\\\n   \"Oh no.  We serve them all day!\"\\\\n\\\\nWhat can you do?  I spoke English and apparently he understood it.  What went wrong is anyone\\\\\\'s guess.  My first experience here was highly negative.  It\\\\\\'s a nice shop, however.  The attendant was friendly and pleasant. Maybe the misunderstanding was somehow all my fault.\\\\n\\\\nRather than buy anything here, pick up a cheap breakfast sandwich at the nearby Terrible\\\\\\'s convenience store. \\\\n\\\\nOr, take your chances on their soups, sandwiches, and salads. There are pretty pictures all around the shop that make the offerings look tasty.\\'\\n \\'sick...and not in the way my college roommate use to say \"that\\\\\\'s sick! \" (meaning cool, awesome, sweet, wicked (variation of any of the previous). No this was just gross. \\\\n\\\\nAfter driving across town to two different malls to find a particular dress in my size, I worked up quite the appetite. Hey it\\\\\\'s Friday- I\\\\\\'ll go for some Americanized Asian...so I ordered the general Tso\\\\\\'s with a maki roll ( not sushi- this is what they call their spring rolls), and noodles.\\\\n\\\\nMy noodles were cold...like really cold. The portion was beyond stingy- normally with these kind of take-out restaurants I cannot finish my meal, but their were exactly 11 pieces of chicken 7 of which were teeny-tiny bits... The texture of both meat and noodles was very mushy and overall not so tasty. When I paid with debit the girl at the counter literally handed my receipt and said \"sign-this\" ...so much for service. I will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible. \\\\n\\\\nI should have known better than to give into mall food cravings...not worth the calories. But hey on a positive note I did find my dress size at CP Mall!\\'\\n \\'Do not eat here! Found hair in food and the manager did not care. Will be filing complaint with health department\\'\\n \"It\\'s always hit or miss depending on who is cooking the chicken. The guy they usually have is lazy, it\\'s better when he\\'s off or on break! . The chicken and shrimp were both undercooked today and lacking teriyaki. Considering they have only a 91.5 on their last inspection that\\'s doubly concerning. \\\\nToday it was overly greasy, and lacking any flavor. A little salt and pepper added during cookie by go a long way FYI. \\\\nCut back on the butter and oil , it\\'s not healthy and like I said very greasy today. The veggies were overlooked and wilty. Sad. \\\\nThey need a new guy on the Chicken, this one has no pride and it shows.\"\\n \"UGH.........\\\\nI stopped by the deli today to grab a sandwich for lunch.  Not many other places in this area to eat so I thought it to be a good choice.  WRONG!!!  So I bought a chicken salad sandwich on a salt bagel and it looked so delectable but as I was eating it I heard a little voice from my tummy - \\'not good\\'.  I just thought that maybe I was disappointed that the sandwich looked so good but didn\\'t taste as good as it looked.  However, 30 minutes later I felt the BBG\\'s (bubbly gut) and off to the toilet I ran.  Soooooo embarrassing when you\\'re stuck in the bathroom at work for half the day.  To make matters worse, my co-worker offered to run to the drugstore to buy me some Kaopectate.  Yeah...not my finest hour.  Thanks Brooklyn Bagels!!!\"\\n \\'I was expecting to get fresh bagels in here but it seemed as if these bagels have been sitting around since yesterday. I believe I have experienced better bagels at the grocery store. The cream cheese was good. For a bagel place, I expect more. I shall try them again. Maybe they could redeem themselves.\\'\\n \\'Honestly... pretty rough looking place... but the food is edible.\\\\nI struggle between a 2 and 3 star rating on this one\\\\n\\\\nPROS:\\\\nLocal;\\\\nProvider of \"comfort foods\";\\\\nInexpensive;\\\\nGood people watching (late-night and early-AM)\\\\n\\\\nCONS:\\\\nVery outdated--in much need of an update/remodel;\\\\n\\\\nGood for an early breakfast or a late-night dinner or dessert!\\\\nThe 1/2 Angry Mob is killer!

It is now Jan 2014 and boarded up still?\\'\\n \\'Preface: I live in the Bay Area now, and I don\\\\\\'t know many Pittsburgh restaurants beyond Primanti Bros.  Further, I booked a dinner at this \"Kitchen and Wine Bar\" before I knew that my companions were not in a wine mood.  Anyways...\\\\n\\\\nThe good news is the service and ambiance were excellent.  All of the servers were friendly and attentive, and the decor was modern yet soothing.  They knew where I could park without feeding a meter and without getting a ticket -- try getting that info on the Embarcadero!\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, I was disappointed in the food.  The salmon tartare was very fishy - mostly the salmon \"caviar.\"  The saffron rice (sidenote: are you afraid to call it risotto because you\\\\\\'re in Aspinwall?   (a) don\\\\\\'t be; and (b) then call it very creamy round grained rice, apparently cooked in broth) was so salty that I actually asked myself if I had done something to offend the chef.  He couldn\\\\\\'t have meant for it to be this salty, unless he recognizes me from 7th grade study hall or something (and if so, put away the salt shaker and come out of the kitchen --  I haven\\\\\\'t forgotten either!)  The short ribs were soft but not as soft as they should be.\\\\n\\\\nFinal note: they offered me a free dessert, which was a nice enough touch that I might actually go back, in the hopes that I just caught the chef on an off night.  Hmmm.  Maybe I do forgive and forget.\\'\\n \"Drinks overpriced.  Crowd was somewhat geriatric, except for us, of course!  We didn\\'t have dinner, so can\\'t comment on that.  Will probably go back to give it one more try.\"\\n \"The worse take out Chinese food I\\'ve ever had! The pineapple chicken was nicely disguised but underneath was full of fat bony parts and hardly any meat. 3 out of the 5 dishes I ordered were wrong. At least the egg rolls were edible! Won\\'t be going back. Waste of money.\"\\n \\'We dropped in last Thursday night and it was the worse meal ever.  It was not busy,\\\\nyet it took 40 minutes to get the appetizer and over an hour to get a sandwich which\\\\narrived cold.  The steak was as thick as a pancake, yet was priced as though it were\\\\na good cut.  Would not recommend this restaurant to friends.  A big disappointment!\\'\\n \\'RIP. This place is now closed down. It is turning into another Lindo Michoacan.\\'\\n \"Super super weird place. Says it\\'s a restaurant but they only had fish and chips on the menu. Groups of homeless people sitting in groups and drinking beer. My son studies at Kumon next door & I was starving- wouldn\\'t have come otherwise. \\\\n\\\\nThey\\'ve got a pool table though. If you\\'re looking for $3 beer, love the smell of urine and are feeling adventurous I highly recommend it.\"\\n \"I am not surprised that I am the first to review.\\\\nI must also disclose that this will be one the few times that I will write a review based on ONE visit - I normally like to visit at least twice but I would like to live to see another day, and I\\'m afraid that may not happen if I go there again.\\\\n\\\\nBackground: me and few friends had been eyeing this spot for a while; but it gave an eerie feeling and we never ventured. Believing in the power in numbers and in the spirit of adventure, 3 of us went - apparently that was not enough.\\\\n\\\\nThe decor? non-existent.\\\\nmenu? well, most were not available but regular pub food. We got burgers and onion rings and pitcher of beer. I will say that was the crispiest rings ever!made me miss Harvey\\'s onion rings very much. Hamburgers were bland and had a home-made quality, definitely filling. The BLT sandwich was just that: bacon, lettuce, tomato between toasts - nothing else....for $4.\\\\n\\\\nBased on the above, I would have returned except, things got weird. \\\\nThe crowd there - sketchy at best (but in that weirdly frightening way- not in the Parkdalian kinda way ), is what would prevent the second visit.\\\\n\\\\nPeople were watching us, music turned out loudly and someone on his way out to pee(I\\'m told), stopped behind my friend and gave me a look. A few minutes later, my friends who are born and raised in the small town ways, strongly advised that i finish the beer - and I did as I was told.\\\\nAs we left, someone half way followed us and another man started screaming - and the staff were nonchalant and indifferent about a mini-fight or the strange group of people just hovering the counter; they weren\\'t going to help us if anything happened.\\\\n\\\\nSo.\\\\nIf you are feeling brave and adventurous, this is where you go. Otherwise, Ronsey is filled with other joyful spots than this, where you don\\'t feel life threatened.\"\\n \\'i have to agree with Shinyi very weird crowd and i can handle rough places.They have to own the building, you could not pay rent selling 3 dollar beers to alcoholics living in nearby roominghouse. very brave to order food the bathroom was bad enough.lower roncy could use a good biker bar, someone needs to take it over.\\'\\n \"I have to say this location offers visitors a very nice expensive meal if that is what they are looking for.  Within walking distances to this property are many authentic Pittsburgh choices.  I found Lydia\\'s place to be well run, exceptional service, but rather expensive.  Also I found the dish I ordered to be very salty.\"\\n \"Rude, rude, RUDE! And not good food. I\\'m not just basing this on one visit. I will always give a second chance. The second time I visited, it was worse! \\\\n\\\\nAnd to SanMeGal K:\\\\nBefore you go calling names, I ordered it take-out both times.\"\\n \\'If you\\\\\\'re going to be cash-only, state it obviously in the menu and put a sign at the door.  The first time I ordered I ordered with a group, we all had cash so we didn\\\\\\'t really think about it.  Then we I went to the actual store we placed out huge order, got everything set and then BAM \"No, no, Cash Only.\"\\\\n\\\\nI don\\\\\\'t mind it ... but PLEASE, a fair warning would have been nice.  As for the food ... it\\\\\\'s average at best.  We\\\\\\'ve tried general tso, chicken with broccoli, and orange chicken.  Nothing to write home about.\\'\\n \"What to say about Chenoy\\'s had many 2AM dinners there over the decade!!! I tend to go there because its open 24H a day not because the food is actually amazing. They have several smoked meat dishes which are okay and it does the jog!!! The menu has a basically almost everything but wouldn\\'t say anything really stands out in terms of dishes.\"\\n \"Une horreur !\\\\n\\\\nOn est peut etre mal tombé mais je donne mon avis quand même. \\\\nNous passons commande a 18h... le livreur arrive a 20h !!! J\\'avais appeler 3x et a chaque fois une personne qui ne parle bien ni le français ni l\\'anglais me . disait 5-10 minutes.\\\\n\\\\nTout est arrivé tiede voir froid...\\\\n\\\\nPlus jamais !\"\\n \"Went here for lunch. Really slow service. People who sat down after us got served as well as got their food before us. My burger wasn\\'t cooked well and tasted awful. When I told them it didn\\'t taste great, they didn\\'t take it back and didn\\'t offer to remove it from the bill. Fries were cold as well. Overpaid for a lunch that made me sick. Won\\'t be going back\"\\n \"I liked the waitress she was nice. However did not enjoy the food. Didn\\'t like their house Italian. Not sure what they put in it. The croutons were saturated with butter. The wedding soup was similar with Eat N Park. The chicken piccata was ok but the sauce could have had a bit more of a bite. The manicotti tasted like it had been frozen. Don\\'t get the raspberry chicken.\"\\n \"It seems this place will be either hit or miss. This time was a miss!  My wife\\'s shrimp was dark, chewy and over cooked. My cannelloni was good, but wedding soup, just mediocre. Waitress did not know what the specials were. I asked for a box for my leftover piece of bread and she picked it up with her bare fingers and put it in a container for me. What?!?!  I asked for dessert forks and she forgot after 10 seconds.  She also talked too much while I\\'m trying to eat.  I\\'m not sure I\\'ll be back.\"\\n \\'8 of us had dinner here last night.  Waitress was not knowledgable, the wedding soup was the worst I\\\\\\'ve ever tasted - if I had to identify the taste it was half lemon broth! The garlic bread was burnt, the salad was of poor quality. Two of us ordered green beans as a side dish and they were generic \"canned\" beans with nothing on them; we were expecting fresh beans, imagine that! After an hour wait for our entree\\\\\\'s most of the them were over cooked and served lukewarm and we had to wait another 5 minutes for the last entree to be served so that we could begin eating.  What a disappointment this was for a what was a rare get together for our group.  This $200.00 meal was our treat to our other guests and I was embarrassed to have chosen it.  I\\\\\\'ve eaten here once before and it was pretty good - something was very wrong!\\'\\n \"Sucked the manager or what ever her title Renee was running around and seemed liked everyone was uptight! Won\\'t be back\"\\n \"Went to Giorgio\\'s for a family reunion type lunch- there were 12 people, and understandably, larger parties take longer to serve....however, Giorgio\\'s took an unbelievably long time for the food to come out to us. Not only did it take long, they brought out meals for 6 us, while the other 6 had to sit and wait another 30 minutes to receive their food. There is no excuse for this. \\\\nWaitresses and staff were nice and polite and were apologetic (they blamed the cooks). However, nothing was compensated for the horrible experience we had there. And it took another 30 minutes to get the check.....who do they have to blame here? \\\\n\\\\nFood was alright... Descriptions of the menu items not available in English so it was VERY unclear on what the dishes actually contained. Had some unsatisfied family members on meals they expected and what they actually received. Prices very high for what the food. ($16 for a Caesar salad?!) \\\\n\\\\nWe will NOT be returning to Giorgio\\'s and I hope you will plan at least 2 hours if you plan to go there to eat....\"\\n \\'Unfortunately, have never been able to try their food because every time our office tries to order, they NEVER have a delivery driver. Apparently, a guy that \"doesn\\\\\\'t show up\". I don\\\\\\'t know about anyone else, but if I just chose to not show up to my job, I would get fired!!! Maybe they should hire someone else?!? My first impression of them is not very good so far...\\'\\n \\'The staff was rude. The food made me and my wife sick for 2 days. It was greasy and not very good. I would not recommend!!!\\'\\n \"I should have known when I pulled into the parking lot to get my takeout order. The lot was packed and this place was empty at 8 on a Saturday. The food was absolutely horrible. We got the large Sicilian with pepperoni. The dough was so undercooked it was raw and gummy. There were three little pepperoni slices stacked on top of each other on each large piece leading to almost no pepperoni in every bite. The garlic knots were dry and the tomato dipping sauce was extremely bland. When we called to complain we were told that this is how this is supposed to be. As I left the restaurant I noticed that the lot was packed because of Emporio on the other end of the building. I suggest giving them a shot over Mamma Lucia. Or even go into Market District to get ingredients to make a pie that won\\'t get you sick.\"\\n \"The staff is incredibly rude. It\\'s been years and nothing has changed. We would order from Mamma Lucia\\'s far more often if everyone wasn\\'t so miserable that works here.  The Sicilian pizza is fantastic, wish we could get it elsewhere.\"\\n \"The average rating for this place far exceeds my expectation. The food here is quite over priced....After spending around $50 dollars on take-out, I had the take a family of 4 to Mcdonalds. My two kids (10 and 12) were complaining about how there wasn\\'t enough food to go around. The only thing that was good about this place was the decor and the fancy plastic carry out boxes they had.\\\\n\\\\nFor me, this restaurant is a once in a life time ordeal. Their food is edible, but it doesn\\'t have anything that sets itself above the other. BoCa isn\\'t anything new, this kind of food you can get just about anywhere for cheaper.\"\\n \"Once upon a time I looked forward to patio season so I could chill with my friends on the patio at Kitchen.  The staff were awesome and the food WAS good.  they used to have this awesome vegetarian sushi that I craved.  It\\'s no longer on the menu... needless to say I won\\'t be going back.  Sucks.\"\\n \\'OK, tried this place for the first time on 3-6-11.  The chicken seemed to be a little over cooked and the flavor was very bland, The Slaw was horrible, Mashed Potatoes and gravy were OK (no biscuits)\\\\nIt almost seemed as if they didnt spice the chicken at all.  i dont beleive I will return (KFC right around the corner)\\\\nOVERALL - 2 out of 10\\'\\n \"We\\'d heard and read about Barberton chicken and heard that this place was where to go to get some.  Yikes.  Greasy, greasy chicken with bad flavor.  The fries were soggy and greasy.  The mashed potatoes were instant with crust lumps.  Instant gravy.  This is the worst fried chicken I\\'ve had in a long time.\"\\n \\'Actually served this owner at my previous workplace so I thought the experience would be superb but boy was I mistaken!!!!  This 1st time I ordered was about mid May 2014 and the person I spoke with on the phone was highly unprofessional and made me feel like I was doing her a disservice by calling in an order. So I brush it off I mean this is cleveland and good service is almost impossible here.  I order about 50$ worth of food for me and my children and was told the wait time would be 45 minutes so after about 2 hours I call and ask what is delaying our food and again get treated like an inconvenience by yet another employee.  I guess they were so busy they had to have the owner come in and help ( I was under the impression being busy was a good thing) so I spoke to this owner George who I served many times at my previous restsraunt and he assures me that my food will get to me hot and delicious well let\\\\\\'s just say when it got to me it was anything but. My wafer fries were cold and disgusting and my cheese sticks were cold as well (yum). Go figure lol. Well before we got off the phone George told me my next order would be discounted.  Fast forward month. My hubby has to be at work at 5 pm so we decide to grab a bite before he goes.  Me and my great ideas want to give Mr hero (ride and denison) another shot because maybe they were just having a bad day? WRONG!!!!! I order 1 roman burger 2 large wafer fries 1 order mozzarella stocks. And she argues with me saying the 9 weer never gives discounts. Twenty five minutes pass after I had already ordered and the grumpy girl says (We ain\\\\\\'t got no mozzarella sticks you gone have to order something else) no explanation no apologies just straight up rudeness. So I order buffalo wings hoping the food might just arrive before my hubby has to leave. 45 minutes pass and guess who calls back? yep you guessed it they have no wings either. The \"manager\" I speak to says that she is tired of me ordering complicated items and that if I 2 on accept something \"easier\" that I can just eat somewhere else. Wow I almost list it but I am a mother trying to set the right example so I ask if the owner could kindly call me back. (oh yeah I end up canceling my order ) when he finally calls me he said that 8 his own words \" he cannot find good help in the ghetto\" and that he will not do anything because he simply does not care. I believe him about not caring because it was quite evident in his tone and verbal demeanor.  He also argued with me saying he never offered me any discount . This place is is a joke and unfortunately had deterred me from ever eating at any Mr hero no matter the location.  My advice if you\\\\\\'re thinking about eating here DON\\\\\\'T.\\'\\n \"This Mr hero has the best food but the guy who works in the front as the cashier I\\'m sure he has to be the owner or close to him cuz he treats the cooks like crap screams yells and had my 6 year daughter scared very poor service will probably never go there again.\"\\n \\'Got what I believe was a violent case of food poisoning at bourbon street during Christmas shopping on 12/16/16.  Enough said!\\'\\n \\'When interviewing for a job, they say the interviewer makes a decision in the first 5 seconds. First impressions are likewise important with food, I\\\\\\'m sorry but pastries and cookies sometimes just look good, and sometimes just don\\\\\\'t. The presentation of pastries here was underwhelming, nothing \"looked\" good, and the decor was subpar (I\\\\\\'m not a big decor guy, but it does leave an impression).  \\\\n\\\\nDer Brokorb is a small tucked away bakery and sandwich place in Woodchester mall.  A selection of freshly baked breads ($3 per loaf) lines the wall behind the counter which has a small selection of pastries, homemade cookies and desserts.\\\\n\\\\nI stopped by for breakfast, but not a whole lot looked especially appetizing. The only thing that quirked my interest was this chocolate almond cookie thing  ($1.50, see the picture), but it wasn\\\\\\'t very tasty. There wasn\\\\\\'t another person in the place, so I\\\\\\'m questioning whether turnover is a problem and how fresh the pastries are.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIndividual apple pies ($3 each), homemade cookies ($3 per box) looked fairly average.\\\\n\\\\nOn the positive side of things, when I walked in through the door I was hit with the smell of freshly baking bread so maybe their breads are pretty good. I wouldn\\\\\\'t mind trying a sandwich, but the pastries and cookies didn\\\\\\'t leave a good impression.  \\\\n\\\\nNot much of a place for decor, had a few tables for sit down as they serve sandwiches and soups during lunch.\\'\\n \"Was not very good. Over priced mealy olives. I bought olives and  asiago cheese and parm pesto. It a waste of a drive. The Gelato was good but it is really out of the way for gelato. We won\\'t go back.\"\\n \"I noticed the spelling is off, rather than Queen Creek it is called Qween Creek in the title. However it came up because I searched for Olive Mill. \\\\nWhen we first got to the place the \\'tour\\' was highly recommended by the person receiving us at the door. \\\\nMy poor rating is due to the totally over priced COMMERCIAL which is called a \\'tour\\' and basically has you seated in a small outdoor tent like structure to give you a 5 minute history lesson about the owners who bought the \\'farm\\' in 1998 and a small lesson on how the olives are harvested. Either with a vibrating rake manually or a machine, depending on how closely the trees are planted. The majority of the time is taken up with giving a video demo of the same info the young tour guide rattled off and then giving a commercial about the spa the wife runs and the many uses for olive oil. \\\\nI can give you the tour right here, right now for free. \\\\nOlive oil goes well with chicken and fish and salads. Now repeat this 4 or 5 times and you\\'ve got the tour. Also if your olive oils go rancid, feel free to use them for skin care. Funny- I use mine for skincare before it goes rancid. \\\\nThe tour DOES NOT INCLUDE a tour of the olive grove. \\\\n\\\\n    I told \\'Emily\\' who called herself an assistant manager that the place was really nice but the tour was an overpriced commercial and left us feeling disappointed. My daughter who took us out payed $28 for the tour and was left not being able to afford the wine she would have loved to buy. We all agreed that the Tour should have been free to allow us to listen and turn around to walk away when we realized it was just a commercial, which I mute at home when I watch TV. \\\\nThe food was yummy, over priced and more of an appetizer portions than a dinner meal. \\\\nIn the end the tour was the disappointment that stuck with us and I will Not recommend this place to my relatives who come out to visit in the future. Please if you go out to the Queen Creek Olive Mill, do yourself a favor and skip the tour. It\\'s a waste of your time. Buy a bottle of wine instead. \\\\n\\\\nIn my daughter Sages words- the tour is a scam.\"\\n \"Braddock Hills sub shop shut down\\\\n\\\\nMay 7, 2016 8:13 AM\\\\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\\\\nThe Braddock Hills restaurant Rudy\\'s Submarines has been ordered closed following a series of violations, the Allegheny County Health Department announced this morning.\\\\n\\\\nOn Thursday, the restaurant\\'s health permit was suspended because it lacked a certified food protection manager, had neither a handwashing sink in the food preparation area nor hot water and soap, and had no date-marking equipment. Counters were not properly cleaned and sanitized, and the floor and ceiling were in poor condition, according to the Health Department.\\\\n\\\\nOn Friday, the Yost Boulevard eatery was found to be operating in spite of the closure order. So a second order has been issued, and a red closure placard placed on the front door.\"\\n \"This place has great food but horrible employees. On more than one occasion I have called in an order and drove to pick it up only to be told that I ordered something else. \\\\n\\\\nThe last time it happened I ordered 2 cheeseburger subs and 2 fries (the usual). The lady working informed me that I ordered 2 philly cheesesteaks. She said she refused to correct the order and demanded that I paid for the food I did not order. I walked out. \\\\n\\\\nIt also doesn\\'t help that this place has had issues passing their health inspections.\"\\n \"We moved to the area not to long ago and decided to try some places close by. We tried triangle and it was fantastic, but decided to go for Rudys this time because it was closer. Terrible mistake! \\\\n\\\\n1. We got 2 chicken phillys and a order of cheese fries. The subs were the blandest thing I have ever ate. It was gross. \\\\n\\\\n2. Our food took 30 min to get done (we were the only ones in there).\\\\n\\\\n3.We got double charged for the fries. They had switched shifts and refused to believe that I already paid for the fries (didn\\'t bother checking at all).\\\\n\\\\nStay far away!\"\\n \"We live in the area and have ordered from Rudy\\'s Subs for years. We take out if we do at all. I don\\'t care to sit inside. They do offer plenty of seating if you choose to.  It can be a hit or miss at times, over the years I have been overly disappointed. The standards in food preparation and quality have diminished over the years. It is extremely expensive for what you receive. All bun and little meat. I wouldn\\'t mind paying extra for the quality, but it is not there. Go to the Rudy\\'s Subs on route 22 in Monroeville. I didn\\'t take a picture of the sub, I was so discussed I threw it out. Will not return.\"\\n \\'I moved back to the area recently and thought I\\\\\\'d check it out despite my friend saying he had food poisoning from there. I live dangerously I suppose. My son and I got a whole \"steak Italian sub\" For $10.99 to go. He ate his and is now afraid of being sick and I couldn\\\\\\'t eat mine after looking at the inside. Oh well!\\\\nThe people working there were really nice, took about 15 mins to get our food to go. Maybe a cold sandwich would be better?\\'\\n \"Il mange, elle boit, c\\'est comme ci, comme ça.\"\\n \"i\\'m all about greasy food, but this place is underwhelming at best. i live nearby so i go once in a blue moon when nothing else is open. the fries are alright, but the onion rings are probably the worst i\\'ve ever had. \\\\n\\\\nall that aside, i almost got run over by a nouveau system delivery car last week, who seriously sped up as i was crossing the street at a pedestrian crosswalk. be wary!\"\\n \\'La nourriture est ok, ambiance familial super.

If you have a business meeting here, DON\\'T ORDER THEIR LUNCH!!!\"\\n \\'This place used to be an OK place but not since new ownership about a year ago. It has really become rundown. I was really hungry and ordered brunch, my table had crumbs all over it, the bacon was burnt and my plate was chipped.  I also asked for peanut butter and jam for my toast and they didn\\\\\\'t have peanut butter.  I am not expecting much from a greasy spoon diner but come on. Plus I was the only customer in there and they had the show \"the view\" on, volume on full blast. I just couldn\\\\\\'t wait to get out of there.\\'\\n \\'Call off the search!  I have found Toronto\\\\\\'s worst cup of coffee!\\\\n\\\\nI stopped in for breakast on my way to Home Delay (Depot, for the uninitiated).  I was in and out in half an hour, and that was all it took to remind me why it\\\\\\'s been so long since my last visit.  \"Under New Management\" does not always mean \"Our food doesn\\\\\\'t suck anymore.\"\\\\n\\\\nMy coffee actually turned grey when I added cream.  I had all-day breakfast, with \"Museum\" sausage - a term borrowed from a neighbour I ran into on my way out - dried and wrinkly, like a mummy.  My eggs over easy had soft, liquid yolks (good) and soft, liquid whites (bad).  Potatoes were tasty, though what else does one expect when they actually ooze butter?  Finally, the rye toast wasn\\\\\\'t very flavourful.  Not sure how that happened.\\\\n\\\\nStar #2 is for the service - I was served in a prompt and friendly fashion by the new owner (of about a month).  I\\\\\\'d have cut him more slack on food, but he\\\\\\'s also the old owner (he sold the place two years ago, then re-bought it for a tidy profit).\\'\\n \\'Well, the food is alright, a bit oily and cheap, but for the prices and area, it is just a bit substandard. I say go for the Chicken Souvlaki on a pita, and the combo is not a bad idea. One thing to do here however is as follows:\\\\n\\\\nLook at the bill you are giving the teller\\\\nSay its face value, out loud\\\\nCount your change\\\\nNearly got conned out of a tenner tonight.\\'\\n \"DO NOT EAT HERE! If you\\'re looking for a home cooked meal, Mexican style.. then this is not the place. The outside gave me a skeptical vibe but my husband insisted we should give them a try. I found 2 eyelashes in my Sopes. We\\'re pescatarian, so no meat for us. We asked for shrimp. The shrimp still had skin on It... wait, what??They\\'re overpriced in my opinion. Not sure how one quesadilla and two sopes came out to $29. The ingredients they use tasted super low quality. Their refried beans with the cheap cheddar cheese they use to garnish, just makes you want to throw up after looking at itt. I\\'m so upset I wasted my money eating here. Another thing that completely pissed me off, is my 2 year old son saw saltine crackers on their picture to accompany the ceviche. I asked if I could have just the saltines for my son. The rep. said she doesn\\'t have any -- that those are old and outdated pictures, understandable! So, I asked if I could have a few chips for my boy instead. She said I have some for sale for $3. I just spent almost $30!!! You couldn\\'t add complimentary chips, like other Mexican places do?! Jesus. And to top It allllllll off, my stomach hurts 30 minutes after eating those Sopes. This is no Gem. This is a rathole with low quality food. The staff sucks.\"\\n \"Large eggshell in my burrito. Since it was so large and also because the guy didn\\'t have even a little smile for me, despite the fact that I smiled, I suspect the eggshell was intentional for the white girl. Scary. I hope he didn\\'t leave too much DNA in my burrito.\"\\n \"always mess up my nachos. never give me back change. i ask them not to put pico de gallo and then they take off the beans or anything else. sometimes they just put everything in it.

I asked a very close relative, whom lived in the Iredell Cabarrus area, she said Lake Todd food is good, off Hwy 3, but She stated she didn\\'t feel comfortable dining in there, she didn\\'t explain why, so myself and husband drove from Charlotte to check it out. I wanted to dine  in, so my food would be fresh and hot, \\\\nWhen we arrived we wasn\\'t greeted properly, maybe they didn\\'t know any better, but that was our first time at their restaurant.I am A very  bold liberal person, in which,  I feel every race creed and color should be treated equally. I didn\\'t feel that in the atmosphere at all, when myself and husband sat down, of course we had to find our own seats, in which is ok, but it seem like everyone in there, even the youths act if they had seen someone from out of space. Very unfriendly atmosphere, to the point we had to get up and leave, without ordering. I am from this area grew up and was raise in this area and lived in this area until I got Married, I have a lot to say, but this isn\\'t the platform to voice it on, but if you don\\'t want to welcome or eat with any other race other than the white race, you should have a sign that says for whites only. I grew up when it was signs like that in Iredell, Cabarrus, Catawba, Rowan, Lincolnton, and Union counties, there are plenty others, but these are the counties where I visit or lived at.  As A young lady I fought hard behind the scenes to make it a better place to lived and work in that area for all race,  til the point my father stated I had  to leave town , because they had Labeled as a Black Militant, and it wasn\\'t safe for me to live there , being a  young country girl , I asked him what did that meant,  and he explained it to me. I couldn\\'t tell no one what he shared with me , so at 17 years of age I moved to Charlotte to live with an Aunt until he told me it was ok to come back. When I went to that Fish Camp it took me back to the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s . I can\\'t apologize for this review ,  I am not telling anyone not to go there, but this is what happen to myself and my husband...and if it has happen to anyone else, speak up,,,,,Think about it!!!\\\\nNo I will not recommend or go back there to eat, And I have white and black African Americans friends...\"\\n \"went with some freinds this weekend to visit cheese mo\\'z was very disappointed.  we ordered 2 different pizza\\'s , both were just okay nothing to brag about.  the pizza with ham, pineapple an pepproni the edge was burned not just from the coal of which our waitress tried to tell us an a few pieces of the ham were burned.    however i will say the meat toppings they were generous with. i will say the cheesey bread was good :)   the service we received was very poor.  three of us had empty glasses we asked her for water an tea it took a while.  that happened at least 3 times this was during lunch on a saturday, they were not croweded at all.\"\\n \"It\\\\nWas about 9\\\\nMonths since we were there and must say we will not be trying this again!\\\\nThe spinach artichoke dip was not too be desired.

I ordered the Salmon Artichoke Pasta and quite frankly, it tasted like a frozen entree that you would buy in the grocery store.  My partner ordered one of the meat pizzas and found it to be heavy and greasy.   We found no reason whatsovever to go back.\\'\\n \"Our group was very dissappointed with the pizza.  The margarita pizza was loaded with garlic which was overpowering - ended up throwing out half of the pizza. However, The Trailblazer, sausage, roasted onions and peppers and portabella mushrooms was good.  The wine was not very good we actually sent it  back becuase it was old.  Best just to stick with the soda. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we went almost 1 year ago, it was very good.maybe it just was not a good night.\\\\n\\\\nIt was not crowded tonight, so that wasn\\'t an issue.\"\\n \"The toilet here is disgusting. I almost lost my appetite after using the women\\'s restroom.\\\\n\\\\nThis Subway has NOT been closed as may have been reported by other Yelpers (I was just there on Friday), but may be it should be.\"\\n \\'Run by college students for college students. Which is good if you are a UW student, bad for everyone else. I have seen fellow students get fat sandwiches and extras for no extra cost. While the rest of the world gets a skinny sandwich and crap service.\\\\nI only go here if I have no other choice. I suggest going down the road to University Station and hit the Subway there. Better service and sandwiches.\\'\\n \\'Reusing mason jars is cool, reusing French fries is not! The fries for our steak came in two colours, fresh fried ones and another darker colour. The darker one after looking at it carefully, the very salty taste of the fries, and the crumple look of the darker fries we concluded it was deep fried already before. Maybe leftovers from previous diner? \\\\n\\\\nThe way too salty taste of the fries spread to the steak as well. It was barely edible, which was a shame because it was a perfect medium rare.\\\\n\\\\nWe also order the 1 lb chicken wings because according to other reviews say it was fall off the bone goodness. We got it grilled because it was healthier. This too was also disappointing. These were the most tasteless wings I have ever put in my mouth. My girlfriend had to take it home and put some soya sauce on it. Yes very Asian.\\\\n\\\\nThe overall ambiance was nice with the reclaim wood wall and the glass doors. The waitress was new and was friendly. She was confused when I replied that the steak and fries were too salty. But if I just wanted nice ambiance and good service I would have went to the museum!\\\\n\\\\nFood 0.5/5\\\\nService 4.0/5\\\\nAmbiance 4.1/5\\\\nValue 0.5/5\\\\n\\\\n=========\\\\n\\\\nOverall 1.48/5\\'\\n \\'The place looked closed but I parked and went in anyway.....first mistake. No one else there....warning!\\\\n  Nothing looked good to me so I ordered eggrolls to go. About the size of my finger, and no filling. BUT they were extra well done....yuk.\\'\\n \\'Take out pho not assembled...raw meat in container with noodles. Gross! Egg drop soup was neon orange. Everything else was just like any other greasy Chinese takeout.\\'\\n \"This was not a great experience.   We waited at least 3-5 minutes before anyone came out of the kitchen to the counter to take our order.  We placed our order and took a seat.   We waited more than 10 minutes for our drinks.  The summer rolls (spring rolls Vietnamese style) were subpar.   They tasted fishy, we\\'re not rolled tight and the peanut sauce was bland and did not have peanuts in it.  The beef pho was ok.  It was warm but pretty bland.   However it was the perfect size.  Not too much, not too little.  Overall not a good experience.  Food wasn\\'t that great and the service was les than desired.  I doubt we will be going back.\"\\n \"Let\\'s start with the positives, banh mi and banh xeo were great. The other three dishes we got to sample, not too flavorful. Perhaps because we went at 2:30 pm and it\\'s an off time (still no excuse) but the entrée dishes were bland with only 4-5 pieces of meat. Can I get some meat in flavorless sauce with my rice? Shesh.  \\\\n\\\\nPerhaps they should just specialize on banh mi sandwiches. We\\'ll make the drive into town and continue going to Central for better Vietnamese food.\"\\n \"The pho was really greasy and flavorless. We had the coconut bubble tea and it was very watered down. Overall, not a great experience. We won\\'t be returning here.\"\\n \"Saigon kitchen is one of the few restaurants that I would never return to, if I could rate it a no star I would. The owner was the rudest person ever!!! Their restaurant was completely dead, and they have a B for their sanitation grade. Don\\'t waste your money or time.\"\\n \"Well it isn\\'t magoos lodge anymore and honestly I don\\'t know what anyone saw in this place if magoos was anything like this! Bar staff isn\\'t very attentive I stood at the bar for a good ten minutes before they even asked if they could help me and there was maybe three people in the whole bar. I heard great things about the food but now that this place is the rustic lounge I guys they decided all that food want necessary cause there is no good in this establishment. It\\'s dusty in here and even for a dive just a really crap place to be at any time of day. With all the killer options around here like legends and hammers if I were you I would just pass by this hole in the wall bummy crowd and really not anything as nice as it looks from the outside.\"\\n \"My friends and I went to Sandey\\'s Broaster Chicken on 1155 S Higley in Mesa, AZ. As loyal customers we are highly disappointed in the change. They have added an Indian Buffet to the restaurant. The macaroni and cheese was not cheesy but tasted like flour and was soupy. The cole slaw had an after taste to it like it had not been properly covered in the refrigerator at night and absorbed the odor of other foods. After leaving the restaurant the smell of the Indian curry lingered in our nostrils and attached to our clothing. Unfortunately, we will now have to find a new Broaster Chicken restaurant. We will not be going back.\"\\n \"The soup wasn\\'t bad, but the guy who was serving it was really creepy and totally ruined the entire experience. Plus, they were out of my first and second choices even though they were supposed to be open for 2 more hours.\"\\n \"Ate here 2 times for breakfast.   Not sure why they have omelette in the name?   The omelette I had was overcooked and rubbery.   It was as though they pre-made them and tried to microwave them before serving (you know, when it\\'s SO HOT in the middle of the omelette? You can\\'t help but suspect microwaving).   \\\\n\\\\nNo.  Stop now.  Turn around, go hit McDonalds if you have to - just don\\'t go here!\\\\n\\\\nEDIT 7/15/16:  This place is no longer in business (gee wonder why?).\"\\n \\'I came into Ollies this morning and ordered a custom made chorizo omelet. While eating the omelet, i noticed that there were several raw pieces on my plate. I brought this to the servers attention who immediately took my plate to go show her boss. When she came back she said it was pieces of \"tendon\". It was very obvious that it was raw meat. Not only did the manager not come to our table to explain and apologize, but she refused to take it off the bill. I will be filing a formal complaint with the health department and will not be going back to Ollies ever again.  Do Not Eat Here!\\'\\n \"I\\'m giving this place a 2 stars because of the fresh omelettes they serve. Other than that...service sucks! You will be waiting for a looooong time before they take your drink order....then another loooong time before they take your food order. If you order coffe...it will also be a loooong wait for a refill. Don\\'t know if they are short staff or what it they need to fix it.\"\\n \"Noooooo, no no. Was really excited to try this place!
