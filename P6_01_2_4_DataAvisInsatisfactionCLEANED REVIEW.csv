"I decided to try Marvellous Edibles because of the rave review the first reviewer gave it, and because it is in my neighborhood of Leaside. I've always driven past it and wondered what it was like, but since she gave it such a great review, I thought I'd give it a go. 

The restaurant has a sort of Parisian cafe feel to it, with mismatched chairs and some booths and tables, and a mural on the wall. Upon arrival mid-Saturday afternoon, we were also presented with 3 menus, breakfast (which was ending shortly), sandwiches and another menu which appeared to be dinner options, priced $16 - $24 range. My friend and I both selected from the sandwich menu. 

I ordered the BLT, but having noticed that they served peameal bacon for breakfast, asked if I could have peameal on my BLT, they obliged, no problem. My friend ordered the meat loaf sandwich and we both ordered the sweet potato fries. 

Service was fast, there were only 2 other occupied tables in the restaurant. I was expecting an average sandwich, didn't really figure you can screw up a BLT, er...thought wrong. The peameal was overcooked, and very dry, and it was served on 'white' bread, no egg or challah bread to be found here!! I was disappointed. The whole sandwich was dry, I asked for mayo, and the waiter said there was already mayo on it, I opened it up and the thing was bare. I showed him, and said, ""Umm, actually there's not..."" (awkward...) 

My friend's meatloaf sandwich was a mess!! First she had asked for no onions, was allergic to them, and upon receiving the sandwich, had to proceed to pick off somewhere in the range of 7-8 pieces of red onion off of her sandwich!! The problem with the sandwich was just that it was a complete mess. It was on a regular bun, and gravy was poured over the meatloaf and the other half of the bun was placed on top. On service, the bottom part of the bun, is soaked, drenched in gravy, making it impossible to pick up! It was just a mess, I think it would be a much more successful item choice if perhaps it was served as an open faced meat loaf sandwich, with the gravy in a boat on the side that you pour on yourself at the time you are going to eat it, so that the bottom bun doesn't disintegrate. 

As if our food quality wasn't bad enough while we were attempting to salvage a meal out of it, our entertainment was listening to our waiter bicker with the other waitress about table assignment and allocation of tips and how unfair she had been. The disagreement got quite heated and their voices were raised, creating quite a bit of tension in the restaurant amongst the customers, or at least, that was my perception. 

Overall, I was not impressed with the food or the service of this restaurant. I would not recommend it. I will not be returning to try their breakfast or brunch, or even to give it a second chance. Unfortunately, that was my very first and last visit. You know what they say, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.",1,decided try marvellous edibles rave review first reviewer gave neighborhood leaside always driven past wondered like since gave great review thought give go restaurant sort parisian cafe feel mismatched chairs booths tables mural wall upon arrival afternoon also presented menus breakfast ending shortly sandwiches another menu appeared dinner options priced range friend selected sandwich menu ordered blt noticed served peameal bacon breakfast asked could peameal blt obliged problem friend ordered meat loaf sandwich ordered sweet potato fries service fast occupied tables restaurant expecting average sandwich really figure screw blt er thought wrong peameal overcooked dry served bread egg challah bread found disappointed whole sandwich dry asked mayo waiter said already mayo opened thing bare showed said umm actually awkward friend meatloaf sandwich mess first asked onions allergic upon receiving sandwich proceed pick somewhere range pieces red onion sandwich problem sandwich complete mess regular bun gravy poured meatloaf half bun placed top service bottom part bun soaked drenched gravy making impossible pick mess think would much successful item choice perhaps served open faced meat loaf sandwich gravy boat side pour time going eat bottom bun disintegrate food quality bad enough attempting salvage meal entertainment listening waiter bicker waitress table assignment allocation tips unfair disagreement got quite heated voices raised creating quite bit tension restaurant amongst customers least perception overall impressed food service restaurant would recommend returning try breakfast brunch even give second chance unfortunately first last visit know say never get second chance make first impression
Came back into town after I moved out of state for a few years. We ordered the normal chicken salad with house dressing and chicken wings seasoned and to be honest. It was nothing like it used to be. The fries were dried out. Dressing was all paste. And the chicken wings didn't seem completely done. It's a shame bc I used to love this place. It def turned my taste buds to go elsewhere though. Hopefully it changes next time I visit!,2,came back town moved state years ordered normal chicken salad house dressing chicken wings seasoned honest nothing like used fries dried dressing paste chicken wings seem completely done shame bc used love place def turned taste buds go elsewhere though hopefully changes next time visit

"Consider this place a mid flight refueling station between the downtown nightclubs and a night in jail somewhere in the Heights lol

Definitely not a place for the faint hearted. I usually frequent the place late hours(2:00am-4:00am crazy huh?). The food is typical greasy spoon but good. The gyros are really good too. They buzz you to the restrooms through a locked door at the top of the stairs(apparently to control the vagrant piss population). They are conveniently located in an abyss of a catacomb basement piss trough(it may be better to wet your pants and stay alive than to chance it...)

"When we arrived it took our waitress considerable time to bring us 2 diet cokes let alone even take our order. She kept walking by us and saying that she would be right with us, however it took her 20 minutes of backing and forthing to actually get to us and the restaurant wasn't even that busy later on a sunday evening. We decided to order calamari with tomato sauce. It was brought out in 35 minutes without tomato sauce. After asking for the tomato sauce, it took another 10 minutes to get it. But I have to say the calamari was probably the only decent thing about this night. We got our food shortly after. I ordered the goat cheese ravioli with smoked salmon. I'm 99% sure that there was little to no goat cheese in my ravioli as it had the taste and texture of ricotta cheese...something you'd pick up frozen at the grocery store. I also had to search for any pieces of smoked salmon as they were miniscule and few and far between. Overall, I've had store bought pasta much better than that. My boyfriend ordered the New York striploin which was supposed to come with tempura onion rings...there were none to be seen. The cut of the steak was completely wrong and the whole middle of the steak was all gristle. He also asked for sauce on the side and his steak was completely coated in it. It was disgusting and I actually felt bad watching him eat it and try to cut the thing. We then sat for 20 minutes waiting for the waitress to clear our plates and give us our bill. She would walk by us continuously and ignore us. We had a coupon for the restaurant which is another reason why we decided to try it, and both waitresses tried to short change us on the value of it, finally after telling them 3 times what needed to be done, they got it right.The service here was atrocious, the food was seriously lacking, especially for the price, the atmosphere was alright however it was freezing because it was cold and drafty.I'd never waste my time going here again and would warn other people about going there.

"This was easily the worst dining experience I have ever had.
I reserved for four people on the Saturday before Mother's day at 7pm. When we arrived we were placed in the bar, with music so loud it made conversation virtually impossible. I asked the hostess about seating in the restaurant as I had reserved and she said it was full. She offered to move us to another table in the bar, ut it was closer to the live music and would have been even noisier.
We ordered some drinks and I was confronted with a bottle of beer, with no glass. There was nothing fine dining about the atmosphere or he service. It was a bar room experience at fine dining prices.
The food was the only thing left to rescue the evening and it was a disaster. I ordered the pork tenderloin which was so overcooked that I thought they has served a pork chop with the bone in. It was also flavorless and burnt. My dining companions also expressed great disappointment with their meals, using terms like flavorless, over-cooked and cold.
We quickly paid the bill and left to seek a more appropriate venue for dessert and coffee. By this time even Tim Horton's seemed appealing.
Avoid this restaurant. The only thing that is fine dining is the pricing.",1,easily worst dining experience ever reserved four people saturday mother day arrived placed bar music loud made conversation virtually impossible asked hostess seating restaurant reserved said full offered move us another table bar ut closer live music would even noisier ordered drinks confronted bottle beer glass nothing fine dining atmosphere service bar room experience fine dining prices food thing left rescue evening disaster ordered pork tenderloin overcooked thought served pork chop bone also flavorless burnt dining companions also expressed great disappointment meals using terms like flavorless cold quickly paid bill left seek appropriate venue dessert coffee time even tim horton seemed appealing avoid restaurant thing fine dining pricing
"I was definitely seeing a lot of red at the Red Martini!  I usually have a 3 strikes and you're out policy... If this were a baseball game, the Red Martini's winning streak would be in the negatives!

It was my high school English teacher's birthday and because she lives I'm the Durham Region we usually dine somewhere in Pickering or Ajax. It gets me out of Toronto once in awhile.  So I had made reservations for 7pm. When we arrived there were 2 occupied tables in the downstairs bar lounge.  We stood there for 5 minutes with no sign of any hostess or staff.  After what seemed like an eternal wait, the waitress appeared and she told us we could choose a table either upstairs or downstairs.  We opted for the upper level.

The Red Martini is a house-converted restaurant, similar to 22 Church Street Bistro across the street.  A co-worker told me that the 2 restaurant are owned by the same owner, however this is unconfirmed.  However I did spot a lot of similarities.

Once we chose our table, again we were left unattended and ignored for awhile. We quickly realized that the waitress who ""greeted"" us downstairs was the only staff in the front end for the entire restaurant. Strike 1 - understaffed.

My high school English teacher loves her white wine and she usually orders the house white.  Strike 2 - they were out of their house white.  This is a clear indication of poor restaurant management.  So we had no other choice than to order the next available white wine which was twice the cost.

We waited for our appetizer - no bread basket appeared - Strike 3 and you're out! 

We ordered and shared the Stuffed Portobello Mushroom Salad to start. This could've easily been THE best tasting salad I've ever had in my life. However, the minor neglect in detail made it second best.  The salad was a deconstructed-style salad. The grilled portobello mushrooms were delicious. The ""stuffing"" was made from imitation crab meat and eggs... So essentially it tasted like an egg salad.  It was also served with COLD naan bread... It would've been the perfect salad if they grilled the naan. We had requested that the appetizer come first and then our mains... However the server showed up 2 minutes into us digging into our salads, so we had to send her back to the kitchen and requested the food be kept warm.

My Coconut Tilapia was served with a spicy plum sauce, Bok Choy, red and yellow bell peppers and jasmine rice. When I first bit into the tilapia I was excited that the fish skin was so crisp... But I quickly realized that the crisp was not due to skillful culinary execution, but rather to a burnt fish... Parts of it were so burnt I started tasting charcoal!  Also, the ""coconut"" component of the dish was M.I.A.  This dish had so much potential.. *sigh*

I didn't try my teacher's Veggie Stir-Fry with Chicken but the feedback I got from her wad that the vegetables were cooked to a mush, and that the chicken was dry.  In their defense, the mush factor may have been a result of the dish being kept on a warming plate.

To finish we ordered a cappuccino, tea and marbled cheesecake.  The server came back up to inform me that they don't offer cappuccino... How do you not know that?  Its like she was a temp hired to tide over a quiet Sunday restaurant service.  So I settled for a coffee.  

The cheesecake was average, nothing spectacular.  

At the end of the day, the bill came to $105.  I will say that the portion sizes are generous and the food does have potential... However, the service aspect is going to need a complete facelift.  I had such high hopes for you Red Martini... I thought you'd be sizzling... But unfortunately the only thing that was red and sizzling about my experience at the Red Martini was my dress and the afterburn in my mouth from the spicy plum sauce!",2,definitely seeing lot red red martini usually strikes policy baseball game red martini winning streak would negatives high school english teacher birthday lives durham region usually dine somewhere pickering ajax gets toronto awhile made reservations arrived occupied tables downstairs bar lounge stood minutes sign hostess staff seemed like eternal wait waitress appeared told us could choose table either upstairs downstairs opted upper level red martini restaurant similar church street bistro across street told restaurant owned owner however unconfirmed however spot lot similarities chose table left unattended ignored awhile quickly realized waitress greeted us downstairs staff front end entire restaurant strike understaffed high school english teacher loves white wine usually orders house white strike house white clear indication poor restaurant management choice order next available white wine twice cost waited appetizer bread basket appeared strike ordered shared stuffed portobello mushroom salad start could easily best tasting salad ever life however minor neglect detail made second best salad salad grilled portobello mushrooms delicious stuffing made imitation crab meat eggs essentially tasted like egg salad also served cold naan bread would perfect salad grilled naan requested appetizer come first mains however server showed minutes us digging salads send back kitchen requested food kept warm coconut tilapia served spicy plum sauce bok choy red yellow bell peppers jasmine rice first bit tilapia excited fish skin crisp quickly realized crisp due skillful culinary execution rather burnt fish parts burnt started tasting charcoal also coconut component dish dish much potential sigh try teacher veggie chicken feedback got wad vegetables cooked mush chicken dry defense mush factor may result dish kept warming plate finish ordered cappuccino tea marbled cheesecake server came back inform offer cappuccino know like temp hired tide quiet sunday restaurant service settled coffee cheesecake average nothing spectacular end day bill came say portion sizes generous food potential however service aspect going need complete facelift high hopes red martini thought sizzling unfortunately thing red sizzling experience red martini dress afterburn mouth spicy plum sauce

Si Senor is not my favorite taco option. I got a steak taco and the bit of steak was so little my meat was about the size of a quarter. I could hardly believe how little meat I had.   I ate here because in the summer they have an outside food stand at the USX tower.  I remember being out of the taco that wanted.  So whenever a food venture is out of something that I want that immediately knocks off some starts for me.  The salsa options were great but I dare say Qdoba is better then this place.,2,si senor favorite taco option got steak taco bit steak little meat size quarter could hardly believe little meat ate summer outside food stand usx tower remember taco wanted whenever food venture something want immediately knocks starts salsa options great dare say qdoba better place

"Ick.  I don't think this classifies as Mexican.  I was mislead by the name but should have known better once I saw they offer wraps.  I figured they used the name wraps in place of burritos since... well... Pittsburgh is really unfamiliar with Mexican food.

I ordered the classic wrap which, according to the description, is your choice of protein, beans, cheese, rice, and choice of sauce stuffed in a tortilla.  I went with the shredded beef and chipotle sauce.  What I got ... well I can see why they referred to it as a wrap and not a burrito.  The tortilla was cold (what?) and the ""shredded beef"" was more like beef chunks.  The iceberg lettuce was an unwelcome surprise.  Black beans.... I hate black beans.  I guess it was wrong to assume they would be pinto or refried.  The chipotle sauce wasn't spicy at all and just added a burnt flavor.

Would never come back.  I can't believe I paid $7.20 for this wrap.  

If for some odd reason you want to try this place.... they do offer vegan / vegetarian options with grilled veggies and tofu as an option for your filling.

"I tried the Gilbert location of this restaurant. I believe it recently opened there on Gilbert Rd, in between Warner Rd & Elliot Rd. It was a cute location, and the atmosphere inside was quaint. 
However, the lighting was much too bright for a restaurant, and the kitchen sounds could be heard throughout the restaurant. 
Overall, my experience was horrible. My food was cold, even though it took 5 minutes longer for my food to come out than the my 3 friends' plates. The coffee was sub par, which made a horrible first impression on me. The price seemed a little much - however, I did not take advantage of the ""pastry bar"", because nothing looked too appetizing. French toast, which I thought was pretty foolproof, did not taste good. And the bacon was covered in maple syrup and some sort of brown sugar. 
I didn't feel too alone; no one in my party had rave reviews for their meals. There were 4 of us altogether, and our food barely fit on the table, which was inconvenient and very annoying. 

If I could give 0 stars, I would. I would say do not waste your time here!

"I used to like Reggies, and was a regular customer, but have found the quality to really become erratic recently, which is a shame.  On it's good days, the best items to try are their comfort foods and breakfasts (all day).  

First, when pulling in, beware, as the parking lot is VERY rough, with MAJOR pot holes.  For your car's sake, GO SLOW!

One item that I've liked here is the ""old fashioned,"" which is a couple potato pancakes (served with sour cream and cheese), couple eggs, breakfast meat, and toast.   Another few that I've liked are their ruben, their Philly Cheese steak, their ciabatta club sandwich, the hot roast beef sandwich (served open face) and their chicken enchilada soup (spicy).  Also, on the weekends, in the morning, they have a ""breakfast bar"", a buffet of typical breakfast items, including eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, pancakes, waffles, corned beef hash and an assortment of fruit.

Their NY Strip steaks seem to be very hit or miss.  I've gotten some excellent steaks, cooked quite well before, but have also gotten a number that felt like half gristle.  It felt like about a 30% chance of getting a bad steak.

Talking more of the erratic quality, an example, one time when I ordered the ciabatta turkey club, I got a sandwich with soggy ciabatta bread and RAW bacon (not just undercooked, it looked like it hadn't been cooked AT ALL!).  I've also gotten eggs burned at random times, bacon burned, hashbrowns burned, etc.  Again, this is not a 100% thing, but it is enough recently to make it not worth my while coming back anytime soon unfortunately.",2,used like reggies regular customer found quality really become erratic recently shame good days best items try comfort foods breakfasts day first pulling beware parking lot rough major pot holes car sake go slow one item liked old fashioned couple potato pancakes served sour cream cheese couple eggs breakfast meat toast another liked ruben philly cheese steak ciabatta club sandwich hot roast beef sandwich served open face chicken enchilada soup spicy also weekends morning breakfast bar buffet typical breakfast items including eggs sausage bacon potatoes pancakes waffles corned beef hash assortment fruit ny strip steaks seem hit miss gotten excellent steaks cooked quite well also gotten number felt like half gristle felt like chance getting bad steak talking erratic quality example one time ordered ciabatta turkey club got sandwich soggy ciabatta bread raw bacon undercooked looked like cooked also gotten eggs burned random times bacon burned hashbrowns burned etc thing enough recently make worth coming back anytime soon unfortunately

"Like one of the other reviewers I had found Reggies adequate but not recommendable from past very irregular visits, (the last has to have been a year or more ago). but we happened there on a Saturday 11 A.M.ish, and were seated promptly by the sixteen year old who was our host.  
He asked what beverages we would like and forgot one and had to get a ""refresh"" in order to fulfill, and then we waited for a waitress. 
We were told our waitress's name by our host and as always unless it's one of those un-names that just blows your socks off, like Kashikeewandamoo, it went in one ear and out the other. 
Unfortunate, because we NEVER got the opportunity to make her acquaintance. 
We waited and waited. And after a bit, decided the breakfast buffet would beat the alternative of nothing, so up we went.  Never realizing how wrong we were!
I have become over the years a less than enthusiastic buffet attendee. 
They tend to be harbingers of germs, old tired food, and some sadist is always trying to set up food far enough on the far side of the sneeze shield so as to require modified limbo dancing or monkey-arms that drag on the floor in order to get what one wants!  
So what did we have?
Absolutely the worst scrambled eggs ever!  So dry and crumbly they virtually refused to be manuvered by a fork as the sand-sized particles lacked the moisture to bind together.  It was like trying to eat flour!  
No waitress from whom to beg ketchup or hot sauce or beverage refills.
Eggs are delicate, don't cook a couple gallons at a throw so you never have to replenish,  cook small batches so the steam table doesn't dehydrate them over time,!  Also whenever possible  try to use real god^amn eggs and not the re-hydrated powdered used-to-be-eggs. 
The country potatoes or whatever they were supposed to be were equally dry, as well as burnt, and did I mention dry?  And man were they dry.  
I ended up putting sausage gravy on them hoping to find something to choke them down with and even that didn't work!  
The bacon was fine, but one does feel just a little silly filling a plate with bacon in order to flesh out one's plate!  
The owner is a very nice guy, (thin as a rail...I can see where eating here exclusively would be a weight-watcher's dream!) and when he walked by I told him we hadn't seen a waitress (we were finished dining at this point), and he said he would take care of us, refreshed our drinks and took them off the bill, so kudos to him for an attempt at a fix, but I would have been much happier had they just set off a bomb at the buffet station to blow it elsewhere, in deference to the well-being of the next hapless diner!

"THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE GOOD FOOD FROM 2005????

This used to be high atop of my list. But several cooks, and two years later, their food has gone completely downhill. Don't worry though, this place is on University Ave between Madison and Middleton, and since most people eating in Madison won't drive too far, there is no worry of accidentally walking into this place. If you do, turn around and RUN out.

Curried Beef Short Ribs used to be incredible, now the recipe is completed different, and sorry, but not very good.

"Ok, there's something to be said about a restaurant that is two blocks away from your house.  Especially if they DO have yummy and fruity Mai Tais, and Lemongrass Martini that's LOADED with alcohol.  On Friday afternoons, it's rather a cool hangout, and great ambiance. 

Their food, however, sucks.  It's supposed to be Asian fusion, and while I am still enjoying any ""fusion"" type place (aka, a hint of ethnic, a ton of Americanization), this is rather mediocre food at best, completely vegetarian unfriendly (which is odd, given the fact that this is Madison).

Service is good though, the staff is kind and attentive.

But I'd only go there for drinks.  Only because well.. I can walk to and from home.... And get a LOADED martini... YUM!

"So far so good. I am not a big wing fan but it is on my way and a new place to try (open two months). 

I ordered the spicy boneless wings. They were crispy, hot, meaty, with no skin and little fat. That was OK with me. 

The celling is tall and the south wall is all glass letting the winter sun in. This gave the place a wide open, airy, ""Texas ice house kind of feel"" (1PM) Which was OK with me because it was a beautiful day, but a little too chilly to sit outside on the patio in shorts. 

Nice tap beer selection especially for Chandler. I had a pint of Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale. Tasted OK to me. 

The bartender was friendly and attentive. I asked her about the tap selection and she had a working knowledge of craft beer. Eventually it came out that she was a beer fan and had a kegerator in her garage (things are getting interesting...). Service was OK with me. 

I like this place so far and will go back to try a different beer and menu item.

Fries are the LAST to go on the tray.

The cook had dropped a wax paper hotdog wrap on the floor, the owner picked it up and returned it to the counter and sure enough, the cook used it. Gross! If you complain - you get ""the special"" - better to just warn others and never return.",1,recently changed owners longer asian owner visited weeks ago fairly large order owner cash coughed register hands proceeded help cook fill order without gloves without washing dirty hands cook dropped wax paper hotdog wrap floor owner picked returned counter sure enough cook used gross complain get special better warn others never return
"Everything TASTED fine when it came to flavor in itself, just isn't put together properly like it use to. I want to say that maybe it's just a new kid getting the hang of it, but like any restaurant, it's still team work and they should be watching eachothers backs.

Ordered with Uber Eats and it came A LOT faster than the displayed time :) I guess because I live less than 5 min away? lol

About 28$ total for the food before any taxes or fees. I ordered 3 items.

No utensils or condements, or noticed they're uber menu asking me if i needed any. Good thing I was at home and not at work or something. I don't recommend this food for delivery as it would probably hold it's quality better if eaten right away in the restaurant, because apparently 5 minutes is too long for this food since they don't wrap it up in proper delivery packages.

One Grilled Cheese sandwich $4.25 : This was literally just a grilled cheese sandwich I could have gotten anywhere for 2$. Regular 2 slices of white toast and kraft single cheese in the middle, and ""pan-fried?"". Would had been nice to have pan fried it in beef juice since they do make burgers there. If they want to go the classic simple route to a grilled cheese while charging this much, then they should have changed the bread and cheese to bring more value to the price, also offer extra charges for side orders like pickles, salted tomatoes, or coleslaw and make it into a meal instead of just the sandwhich, of which I won't be ordering again if it stays the same. Because it was wrapped in wax paper, the heat excaped, cooling it down to the point where the cheese nearly solidifies and no longer stretches :(

One Smoke Meat sandwich $8.95 : This is actually pretty expensive for a smoked meat sandwich. The tiny bread was funny compared to the mountain of smoked meat, but I could live with that. What concerned me was the pale color of the meat. Tasted fine at least, nice moist and flavorful, but it came with nothing else for it's price?! Wierd, not even pickles or something... It was still more on the cold side eventhough they did wrap it up with metalic paper, so I don't know what is going on there.

Medium Sized Sausage Poutine $10.45 + extra cheese $4 : They apparently think HOT DOG WEINERS are sausages?! No way, that has to be a mislead because they have ""HOT DOGS"" written in the rest of their menu. They need to edit that because I was really disapointed, eventhough they gave me a mountain of these sliced weiners. As I was digging in, I have to say I laughed when I realized that I was having a hard time finding the fries lol I literally had more cheese than fries LOL I shouldn't have ordered the extra cheese because they honor it way more than any other food place I've ever seen, it was almost cute lol. It also wasn't hot enough, so the cheese curds didn't semi-melt. The gravy sauce tasted nice, though the quantity was lacking, and the fries were on the light side and soft, when LBP use to make them a lot darker. They put it in a styrofoam packaged which sucks compared to their older aluminum pie packages, so not only did it leak, but most of it's heat was lost in the 5 min travel time, which is really fast, and like I said, the way they package their food is not meant to be delivered, it's meant to be eaten there at their location, and I don't think they realise that.

Reading some of these reviews only now... I think the changes I noticed is all these peoples fault lol #1 You're supposed to wait a good 5 min before eating poutine ! That HEAT is the finishing touch of the cooking!

To the Restaurant Owner: I know how hard it can be to please everyone. Change one thing, and the ones who previously liked it will complain lol What I wish more restaurants/fast food places would do is offer more detailed choices on orders, that way you can't really go wrong. It's not enough to just have a ""note"" customers can write to the restaurant for each order, because I can imagine some changes will effect the price and I don't want a restaurant to feel their budget is breaking.

First impressions..this place is completely dead nowadays.  We walked in and the hostess was completely glued to the tv. We were literally standing there for a good 5 mins until my brother cleared his throat lol.  We sat down and already knew what we wanted since we pretty much know the breakfast menu in and out.  We ordered two orders of the two egg breakfast with sausage with a side of bacon. She then brought out two orders one with bacon and one with sausage. We then went and explained to her we both had sausage with sides of bacon.  She then brought out another side of bacon, which looked like it was quickly microwaved and totally tasted like chewy crap.  The order of sausage? Nowhere to be found....

We then asked for our check we got charged for 2x's sides of bacon and sausage. (the sausage was suppose to be included in the breakfast)  we didn't even bother to say anything and just paid the bill.

All in all... The service was horrid.  The food has gone down the drain..What a bad experience. Back then I would have given this place a 4/5 easy.

"I get it, people get annoyed when someone says "" I'm from NY so I know good wings, pizza, subs, italian food, bagels etc"" and why doesn't Charlotte have these things? 

but generally I dismiss that because I have found all good versions of the above at some location. Nothing is ever the same as where you grow up- whether you're from NY or from Albuquerque (or insert random hometown)

But that being said Substation II really reminded me of everything a meatball sub should NOT be...

My remembrance of a meatball sub:

Served on a toasted hot garlicky Italian sub roll topped with oooey gooey mozzarella, three large homemade meatballs, and sauce that would put your Italian grandmother to shame.

What I got - Salty McSalterson's sauce and 10 mini meatballs that easily came from the frozen foods section. If that was what I wanted I would head over to HT and pick some up myself. Sadly this sub had little cheese to offer but luckily the bread was at least fresh. Do yourself a favor and for 50 cents extra head to subway and get their foot-long because essentially they are on the same caliber ...actually if I am honest, subways rivaled theirs. 

They also have ""scrap"" sandwich on their menu ...I am not sure how this is suppose to sound appealing.

"This all day breakfast and steak place is located near the main runway at Pearson on Airport Road south of Derry Road. There is lots of parking and the space is quite large. They have a wide selection of quick steak meals as well as burgers, fries, and other grilled or deep fried foods. I had a steak on a bun and although the taste was OK, the steak soaked the bun making it difficult to eat with a knife and fork. However, the overall quality was OK.

My issue with this place is the cleanliness or lack of it. The place seemed dirty with many tables still holding used plates with old food. I don't understand why that needs to be that way since the place had 3 people in there when I walked in.  I had to search for a table as far away from one that had old food and plates on it. The washroom is disgustingly dirty and I can't understand why restaurants don't pay more attention to this area.

It's amazing how effective a fresh coat of paint and some clean washrooms can be in gaining loyalty from repeat customers. Until this place cleans up, I would never go back there.

"I entered Shabu Fondue this evening anticipating a fun and filling meal. While fondue is always fun, I found this particular meal was lacking in the filling department. My husband and I ordered the cheese course for two (swiss and emmenthal cheeses with white wine and lemon), which was really delicious with apple slices and bread chunks. We followed up with steak and chicken (served with a selection of vegs and a hot, seasoned chicken broth). In retrospect, we should have given this course a miss and ordered more of the cheese! 

The cheese course cost us $13.00 for two (portion size was very small), while the ribeye cost $15.95 and the chicken $14.95 (all prices exclusive of taxes). We both definitely felt that we would have been better off eating at The Melting Pot because, while it is more expensive, it offers better value -- bigger portions, a larger selection of meats and seafood, more choices in regards to cooking methods (oils and different kinds of broths), and fixed price menus for groups with 2+ people. 

The atmosphere at Shabu was also lacking. A restaurant's quality can often be measured by how many covers it has in an evening. On the day after Christmas Day a restaurant should be buzzing. Shabu was nearly empty.

I will say that our server was quite excellent, though. She was attentive and a great conversationalist. If the food we had consumed had been to the same standard, I would definitely have rated this restaurant with 5 stars.",2,entered shabu fondue evening anticipating fun filling meal fondue always fun found particular meal lacking filling department husband ordered cheese course two swiss emmenthal cheeses white wine lemon really delicious apple slices bread chunks followed steak chicken served selection vegs hot seasoned chicken broth retrospect given course miss ordered cheese cheese course cost us two portion size small ribeye cost chicken prices exclusive taxes definitely felt would better eating melting pot expensive offers better value bigger portions larger selection meats seafood choices regards cooking methods oils different kinds broths fixed price menus groups people atmosphere shabu also lacking restaurant quality often measured many covers evening day christmas day restaurant buzzing shabu nearly empty say server quite excellent though attentive great conversationalist food consumed standard would definitely rated restaurant stars
"The service was horrible!  Forever between courses, no wait staff was ever around.  Our waiter actually turned off the burner as he served our main course.  We could not cook our meal!!!  Then we couldn't find anyone to turn the dang thing on.  It took 15 minutes for someone to appear where we could flag them down.  It was a Wednesday night and only 5 tables had customers, so no excuses there.  It was horrible.

Decent assortment of veggies, but I felt like I was in Munchkinland, with the portions. The dessert... well, who can go wrong with chocolate and caramel? Only chocolate and peanut butter would have topped that.

"Terrible food.

I saw reviews on here saying there is good popcorn chicken and I work close by so I thought I'd try it out.

""We don't have any cooked.""

""Ok what about a 3 piece meal?""

""Sorry we have no chicken cooked""

""What do you have ready?""

""Just wings.""

""Ok give me a wing meal with honey garlic""

""How many wings?""

""Whatever comes in the meal."" I look at the little piece of paper ""It says 6 here...give me 6.""

""What size wedges?""

""Whatever comes with the meal...a small I guess?""

Got my food and meal should be $7 with wings a pop and wedges according to their menu and I get charges $9 and change (tax I'm sure) and get no pop. I'm done though so I just leave.

Get back to my work and open my food and the wings are cold and dry. I could have gotten better from the freezer section of the No Frills nearby, and the wedges are not seasoned in any way but taste like they were tossed in flour and also cold. Obviously everything was made hours ago and just sat under a lamp.

"I'm so grossed out right now, I got the Hungry Man combo to go with 4 pieces of chicken. When I arrived home I realized everything was COLD. Some pieces were sort of room temperature/COLD, some were kind of lukewarm but not warm enough to be good. This is not safe! Food must be kept at a certain temperature. It's also rude to sell food that isn't even at the proper temperature to taste good. Obviously the food had been sitting out all day and was cooked a long time ago. I would rather she told me the food was old so I could go elsewhere. The potato wedges were cold as well. If it were a normal restaurant I would storm back and return everything, but it's a weird little hole in the wall in st Jamestown and I don't need the drama. Never again!!!!

"Scruffy's is the very definition of grungy pub. I work pretty close to this pub so my meeting with this pub was bound to happen. 

Let me start of with the good things about this pub: 
-Layout: Scruffy's has a great layout, it is cozy enough to be a stop for a first date and large enough to accommodate large parties of 20+ guests. 
-Servers: they are polite, will take your order and get it right more often than not (!!) which is surprising for a pub and even crack a joke once in a while 
-Prices: drinks are cheap, assuming you don't want anything too fancy ....grungy pub = cheap (local) drinks

That is unfortunately where the good things end. If you're going to Scruffy's for food, you will be disappointed. There's no question in my mind about this fact: their food sucks. To top it off, it's overpriced. There are countless other places with better food in the same intersection. 

Finally (this is the big reason they lose points), the service here is the WORST. You're probably thinking, ""David, you said the staff is great. What gives?"". Well dear reader, although the staff is wonderful, the process this pub has set up to transfer food orders into food is very bad. 

Story time:
Went with some work buddies (about 7 of us in total) for a quick lunch and drinks. Ordered our food and began our never-ending wait. We get our drinks a little late (~15 minutes after ordering). We finish our drinks, and we're told the food will be right there ""just order another round"". We order another round. Finish the 2nd round. No drinks. It's been ~45 minutes by this time. Finally, almost an hour after ordering our food/drinks, all of our food arrives (together thank goodness). Our quick lunch+drinks turns into an hour and a half of waiting/

All in all, Scruffy's is a great place to go for a quick drink, maybe some dirty food ....and that's it. 

TL:DR: cheap drinks (nothing fancy), awesome layout, garbage food and horrible process flow",2,scruffy definition grungy pub work pretty close pub meeting pub bound happen let start good things pub scruffy great layout cozy enough stop first date large enough accommodate large parties guests polite take order get right often surprising pub even crack joke drinks cheap assuming want anything fancy grungy pub cheap local drinks unfortunately good things end going scruffy food disappointed question mind fact food sucks top overpriced countless places better food intersection finally big reason lose points service worst probably thinking david said staff great gives well dear reader although staff wonderful process pub set transfer food orders food bad story time went work buddies us total quick lunch drinks ordered food began wait get drinks little late minutes ordering finish drinks told food right order another round order another round finish round drinks minutes time finally almost hour ordering food arrives together thank goodness quick turns hour half scruffy great place go quick drink maybe dirty food tl dr cheap drinks nothing fancy awesome layout garbage food horrible process flow

"Frequent Disappointment.  This is yet another perfect example of a non-franchise establishment not being aware of their customer and thus dropping the proverbial ball.  Apparently under new management, there has been no change in food or environment despite the new management.  They have a no children rule after 9, which alienates them from potential customers who would order food and possibly imports and keeps the 5 patrons instead who continue to drink their bottom barrel domestic.  I don't have a real big issue the kids after 9, but they turned away a party of 20 twice who were hungry and thirsty and instead catered to the 3 patrons at 9:00 PM on a weeknight.  Well done.

"I really wanted to believe in Cafe Soleil, but it didn't live up to my expectations. We came here twice in one day: 1. early morning for pastries before hitting the Farmer's Market and 2. to pick up some lunch before heading out of town on our way home. The first experience was ok. Hailing from France, I was secretly hoping for real French pastries. The baguette was dense and dry, the epi baguette seemed to be the best bread choice (though a tad dry), and the almond croissant, although deliciously almond-y, was quite heavy. Our second experience that day, however, left us frustrated. We ordered a house salad with grilled chicken to go. The menu described market greens and house vinaigrette-simple enough. 20 miles out of Madison we realized that we had slimy mustard greens, with mealy apples, extremely potent cheese (and believe me I can handle my cheese), and a few measly bites of chicken. $9 seemed outrageous for what looked like week old leftovers.

Last sunday, my mom and I were out on a power shopping spree at the pavillions when she said she wanted to go to Souper Salad, not wanting to i begruggingly agreed. We even dug through our back seat looking for their coupon in the sunday paper for a discount! We walked up and sat down and saw their DIRTY patio furniture... wtf?! Don't these people own a hose?! That was so dirty, I couldn't imagine trying to have a nice al fresco dining experience there! Luckily for me, it was the dirtiest part of the resturant.

We approached the door when a very loud man came and opened the door and exchanged pleasantries over and over again and was very happy to see us. Ummm... thanks? but can we atleast order our drinks first? He was a little happy. I unno - I was in a good mood, but I sorta just wanted to be left alone to eat. We got our salads and the greens were semi wilted and the cesar salad needed to be refilled but didn't :( and so I was left with some odd franken salad I threw together on my own. It wasn't that great - but that's my own doing. 

Their pasta salads and cole slaw and some of their fixin's looked very old and unappetizing! I couldn't even imagine eating them! I wished they had potato salad or carrot slaw (is that the word?) and macaroni salad... it wasn't good. But things did lighten up when I came across the soups.

I loooove soups!! They are my salvation after a hard day. I cozied up to a lil bowl of tomato based soup with mini shell pasta and veggies, it was delish! So was the Veggie Beef soup. I wish it didn't have so much onion,but I'm not a big fan of onions. and their tacos were GOOOOOD... not write home and tell everyone about it good... but very good. They remind me of the kind of tacos you make at home, out of a box but not all craptastic like how they come out when I do it. I honestly liked it. 

The cornbread was dry and my mom said her baked potato was too. The pizza looked too old to touch, so I unno about that one. 

The service was another thing... the same man, who I'm assuming is the owner always kept talking. Even when my mom said something along the lines of just wanting to enjoy our meals and we thanked him for his hospitatlity. But damn... SHUT UP! I felt like he wanted to sit down and talk shop with us... but we weren't there to meet with him... we were there to talk with one another. But he always refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly. So he got to keeep a star. 

To my fellow yelpers: if you're in the area and want fresh salads, this might not be the place for you... especially if you want to eat outside cafe style on nice clean patio furniture... but if you want a nice cozy bowl (or several like me) of soup and decent bread sticks then this place will hit the spot.

"Hard to figure this place out.  It has a surprisingly hip decor for Pittsburgh, which seems trapped either in some smoky dive bar nightmare or early 80s design.  Despite the design and relatively attentive service I do have complaints.  There are flat screen tvs everywhere!  Can i find a nice bar in this stupid town w/o 10 tvs playing sports? Also, to ruin the night they had one guy poorly playing covers on an electric guitar, what was the point of that?

The drinks were good but the food there is terrible and overpriced.  I'd go there for drinks if there was no musician and they turned the damn televisions off!

"This business has closed, and judging by the ""sheriff's sale"" postings, it will not be reopening... 

Gone is the pleasure of the proprietors and waitstaff x-raying your wallet and checking how expensive your shoes look as you enter, that is, if they pay you any attention at all. No more sitting drinkless as the only customers during ""happy"" hour, while the owner shmoozes a liquor vendor (a woman who repeatedly used the word ""zing-fen-dale,"" no joke) in the comfy lounge seats next to you. 

Someone needs to get the message: upscale (real or imagined) is not the only way to succeed on the developing East Liberty/Shadyside edge, no matter how desperately the Red Rooms and Richard Chens of the world may think so.

"Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I'll try to be fair though but I'm writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing. So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.  

Texas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.

Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :( 

Entrees.

Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:) 

Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned. 

Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.

Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible: 

Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that's for this occasion only , past two times it's been great fun for the kid,)

"Went on a week night for an early dinner - there were not that many tables occupied.  First off, as soon as we walked through the door we were hit with a bad odor (it smelled like a sewage/ventilation problem?).  Having been there several times before, I knew not to expect ambiance and that is one thing, but it could really stand a good cleaning (everything just looked like it would be sticky to touch, the table had something that looked like a dead bug stuck to it, walls were splattered with who knows what, and the menus were FILTHY -  I could go on....).  

We started with a cup of french onion soup with a side of french bread (both delicious).  For the main dish we split the chicken crepe and chicken salad sandwich.  The sandwich was very good.  The crepe was really very, very rich.  Did not like that the crepe was folded and not stuffed, and there was too much sauce for our taste.  I have had this before but probably would not order it again.  Ordered a plain crepe with sugar.  This took FOREVER to come out.  In the meantime the waitress was nowhere to be found - she did not offer a refill on my coffee, nor did she clear the dishes.  There were only a handful of tables occupies, and I counted at least 3 females and 1 or 2 male staff, so as far as I was concerned there was no excuse.  When the dessert finally came, dirty dishes still on table, I asked for a coffee refill but never did get it.  And there was no apology for the wait.  The dessert crepe itself was so-so - soggy on the bottom from moisture.  My family said that they much prefer the crepes I make at home.

Overall, a disappointment, as I would sooo love a decent crepe place nearby.",2,went week night early dinner many tables occupied first soon walked door hit bad odor smelled like problem several times knew expect ambiance one thing could really stand good cleaning everything looked like would sticky touch table something looked like dead bug stuck walls splattered knows menus filthy could go started cup french onion soup side french bread delicious main dish split chicken crepe chicken salad sandwich sandwich good crepe really rich like crepe folded stuffed much sauce taste probably would order ordered plain crepe sugar took forever come meantime waitress nowhere found offer refill coffee clear dishes handful tables occupies counted least females male staff far concerned excuse dessert finally came dirty dishes still table asked coffee refill never get apology wait dessert crepe soggy bottom moisture family said much prefer crepes make home overall disappointment would sooo love decent crepe place nearby

"This place was fun and tries very hard to please....but there are a few drawbacks and it falls short of many Montreal restaurants which easily get three stars. Most of the portions were way too small more suitable for people on diets. I ordered a salmon and shrimp main dish as part of the Tabledote, it was tasty and nicely presented on cool plate of black slate. Maybe there was one shrimp sliced in half and two or three bites of salmon on the skewer and that was it. Another skewer would have  satisfied. The beet and goat cheese salad was very light on the cheese about a teaspoon. My friends plates looked skimpy too with the exception of the steak frites. A glass of wine was included with the dinner but it had a few fruit flies floating in it. The server politely replaced it, but, the damage was already done.  In an attempt to be loungy and ""tres cool"" some housy/techno music was blasting everywhere making table conversation difficult. On the plus side it was a fun atmosphere and the presentation of the food was done creatively. It shouldn't take too much to bring this place to a much higher standard. So I wont return until it gets there.",2,place fun tries hard please drawbacks falls short many montreal restaurants easily get three stars portions way small suitable people diets ordered salmon shrimp main dish part tabledote tasty nicely presented cool plate black slate maybe one shrimp sliced half two three bites salmon skewer another skewer would satisfied beet goat cheese salad light cheese teaspoon friends plates looked skimpy exception steak frites glass wine included dinner fruit flies floating server politely replaced damage already done attempt loungy tres cool music blasting everywhere making table conversation difficult plus side fun atmosphere presentation food done creatively take much bring place much higher standard wont return gets

"Ho-hum. Why do we always wind up at average chain restaurants. I'm firmly placing blame on someone else, namely my partner. I like to plan, he doesn't, so we wind up at average or less than average chain restaurants. 

We tried to go see a movie late this afternoon but it winds up everything we wanted to see was sold out. So we perused Sport Mart for a while, got a couple deals and then he said: ""I'm really hungry."" So it was between White Chocolate Grill and McGrath's Fish House. Since we'd been to White Chocolate and McGrath's would give me another opporunity to write a review on yelp we decided on McGrath's. This was not the better of the two choices.

They seated us in a cavernous dining room that was empty save for two other groups of diners. In addition the room was very warm. I must depart from the review to let you know my partner is HOT, and not just in the way your dirty minds are thinking. So, shortly after being seated we're both very uncomfortable.

The good news is the service from our waiter Adam was great. The food, well it was just okay. We started with the Calamari Rings which were, you guessed it, just okay. I ordered Wood Fired Salmon and he ordered a King's Platter. The Salmon was far from wood-fired, grilled with some wood flavored seasoning sprinkled on it, I can do that at home. My partner's platter was also just okay. He said there's no reason to come back here. I have to say I must concur. 

Another average chain restaurant.

"Up on the second floor of the Pacific Mall, this small counter restaurant is reputed to make some really good food for affordable prices.  It is the no frills of no frills.

When I got there it was late in the evening and about an hour or two from the mall closing.  It was the busiest of all of the counters in that section and price range.  The P.Mall is cramped at the best of times and it felt that way with even half the capacity in the area.

Now the food looks good and there were so many selections that it was difficult to choose.  I saw they had shrimp in lobster sauce over rice.  It is a simple dish but I had not had it in ages so I ordered it.  

Not how my dad used to make it and it was a little on the salty side, which I can do without.  In spite of that, I am not ready to give up on this little cubby hole though.  I'll be back and hopefully they will give me reason to lift the review to something more respectable.

I'm hoping it was an 'off dish' for them and that it will not happen again.

"Definitely not an accommodating place at all. When I first came to this restaurant, I asked them if they can substitute their meat in a fried noodle dish with tofu instead. I told them that I was willing to pay extra for this substitution and was willing to wait longer for them to prepare it. Keep in mind that this was late afternoon and there were maybe only 5 other people in total in the food court, most of whom were already eating their meals and the worker was just lounging around. 

He then told me that he could not substitute any meal with tofu instead of meat. First of all, tofu is cheaper than meat and I was willing to pay extra for it. Second of all, the restaurant that I went to next, RIGHT BESIDE this place, Casa Formosa, not only gladly substituted the meat for tofu for any of their dishes, but also let me choose what kind of tofu I wanted. 

I'm extremely disappointed since I know many Chinese vegetarians in the area who have converted due to their religion. I will point out that they do have 2 vegetarian dishes, however, having only 2 makes it get boring real quickly and it's not like adding tofu to the pan instead of meat is hard.

"Let me set the mood for you: 

It's the first cool night in Phoenix in 17 years (at least it seems that way) cool breezes blow across the desert landscape, dry air has set in, The Redsox, Indians, and D'backs all have a 2 to 0 lead in their respective series, Manny Ramirez Just hit a 3 run walk off home run in the bottom of the 9th to win the Redsox play-off game, the Yankees lost in 11 innings!! 

I don't think I could ask for a more perfect night, like God came down for 1 second and said ""Hey, I'll make all your dreams come true buddy.""

Enter Sugar Daddy's....

A few ex-coworkers invited me here, and since it was close I head over after the Sox game concluded. I am not  a big fan of Scottsdale bars in general, but went to see some friends. I even brought a sweatshirt for a friend per her request, who was ""chilly"" (see the above description of the weather)First let me say,  the patio is pretty cool, you can sit outside and enjoy the weather, being next to Scottsdale Rd, isn't so great, as wanna-be Hell's Angels cruise by on their bikes, buzzing the place like Tom Cruise in Top Gun. All that aside they had live music, basically A Dashboard Confessionals style, emo-acoustic  band. They were entertaining. The drink prices are reasonable, though a friend of mine (a girl) was billed for 21 miller Lites, which she claimed, ""was impossible to drink in 4 hours"" I said, ""well it is Miller Lite, which is basically seltzer water, with a splash of hops and barely, so you really could of had 21 beers"" She proceeded to drive herself home, you do the math. 
For the crowd, it would be what you'd expect, but a little better than what you see in old town Scottsdale, people were more down to Earth here, and pretty cool and laid back. I had no problem with the crowd, it was mellow. 
So as my friends decided to leave I ventured into the ""labyrinth  inside, and let me say this place is huge. The decor is like something out  of a Robert Rodriguez movie (insert from Dusk Till Dawn) and The set of The Munsters.  To me it had no real identity and conflicted completely with the patio style of Mexican Cantina. Inside there are many areas to get lost in, and dark corners were I could imagine horny Scottsdalians making out, and participating in heavy petting. After locating the bathroom, using my onboard GPS system, I decided to sit at the patio bar to finish my drink. I struck up a conversation with 2 of the female bartenders, as they were attractive, and emo/punk/tatoo'd/angst looking. (I can't help myself with girls like this sometimes) So one of The Donnas (reference to the rock-band of all girls that look the same) started to explain to me she spoke sign language, and could communicate this way. As we were talking she became more and more annoying, it is hard to believe that someone could sign, and be annoying, but it happened. I spoke to her, and found her to be rude, and somewhat obnoxious, it really just solidified my opinion of this place and left me with a bad taste in my mouth, like waking up in the morning after you had some cool-ranch Dorititos before bed. You try hard to remove the taste, brushing, mouth-wash, flossing, etc, but it just stays with you until you eat lunch.....Unfortunately  I haven't eaten lunch yet.",2,let set mood first cool night phoenix years least seems way cool breezes blow across desert landscape dry air set redsox indians lead respective series manny ramirez hit run walk home run bottom win redsox game yankees lost innings think could ask perfect night like god came second said hey make dreams come true buddy enter sugar daddy invited since close head sox game concluded big fan scottsdale bars general went see friends even brought sweatshirt friend per request chilly see description weather first let say patio pretty cool sit outside enjoy weather next scottsdale rd great hell angels cruise bikes buzzing place like tom cruise top gun aside live music basically dashboard confessionals style band entertaining drink prices reasonable though friend mine girl billed miller lites claimed impossible drink hours said well miller lite basically seltzer water splash hops barely really could beers proceeded drive home math crowd would expect little better see old town scottsdale people earth pretty cool laid back problem crowd mellow friends decided leave ventured labyrinth inside let say place huge decor like something robert rodriguez movie insert dusk till dawn set munsters real identity conflicted completely patio style mexican cantina inside many areas get lost dark corners could imagine horny scottsdalians making participating heavy petting locating bathroom using onboard gps system decided sit patio bar finish drink struck conversation female bartenders attractive looking ca help girls like sometimes one donnas reference girls look started explain spoke sign language could communicate way talking became annoying hard believe someone could sign annoying happened spoke found rude somewhat obnoxious really solidified opinion place left bad taste mouth like waking morning dorititos bed try hard remove taste brushing flossing etc stays eat lunch unfortunately eaten lunch yet
"If this place doesn't serve as a case study of what ""wasted opportunity"" and ""terrible management"" looks like, then show me another place like Sugar Daddy's that frighteningly resembles Chernobyl 1986.

In fact, this place would be freaking AWESOME if it was plopped down on 3rd Street and Roosevelt.  But it had two major things working against it: 1) Their kickarse patio faces the lame part of Scottsdale Road, and 2) Their kickarse property is in the lame part of Scottsdale Road.

It's fast food but with sit down prices and barely fast food taste.

The taco platter Jesse mentioned, is three street tacos on a styrofoam plate which has other little compartments filled with a a few spoonfuls of rice, beans, avocado sauce, and chopped lettuce.  They sprinkle a handful of chips over the top.

The meat isn't char grilled, but steamed on a flat-top and is greasy/wet enough that the little tortillas break apart before you get halfway through the first one.  I ended up dumping the mix into a pile, tossing the tortillas, and eating it like cereal.  

Not horrible, but also not worth the price.

We wondered if it was closed but did see a few people eating.  It was dark - can't read the menu dark and freezing cold.  My salad was so drenched in dressing that I really couldn't eat it (my fault I didn't ask for dressing on the side?).  I give them two stars because fortunately it is no smoking and the waiter was ok.,2,went fitch lunch last week disappointed reastaurant empty one seated us came door close five minutes wondered closed see people eating dark ca read menu dark freezing cold salad drenched dressing really could eat fault ask dressing side give two stars fortunately smoking waiter ok

"We usually frequent another chinese restaraunts in our area, but after receiving a flyer in the mail with a coupon we decided to try Oakridge Phoenix....horrible idea.

We ordered spring rolls and pork gyozas/dumpling.  Both were very fried to a dark brown making them quite dry.  The dumpling filling was an odd flavor unlike any I've had before.  The spring roll was hideously sweet, from what I don't know.  Neither had a fresh vegetable taste, they were more like they had been mixed with the meat ages ago and became muddy.  

We ordered Pork Egg Foo Young  which was literally just egg, carrots, peas and sprouts.  Though the veggies were at least fresh the whole thing was devoid of any seasoning or flavor.  Also most places serve it with some kind of sauce, there was none.  Just a huge hunk of egg and veggies, that's it.  

We also ordered almond soo gai.  Again this was fried within a shade of being black.  The chicken inside was so dry it was not edible.  I would guess they were frozen for far too long and acquired freezer burn.  

Finally the coupon was for a free order of Chicken fried  rice.  It was literally rice and chicken with a few peas sprinkled on top.  Again no flavor, no seasoning and the chicken was dry as dry can be.  The rice was oddly plump and hard.  

Needless to say we will not try this place again.  Clearly they are cutting corners by over freezing food that doesn't get rotated frequently enough.  And I've never had such bland or oddly flavored food, especially chinese food.",1,usually frequent another chinese restaraunts area receiving flyer mail coupon decided try oakridge phoenix horrible idea ordered spring rolls pork fried dark brown making quite dry dumpling filling odd flavor unlike spring roll hideously sweet know neither fresh vegetable taste like mixed meat ages ago became muddy ordered pork egg foo young literally egg carrots peas sprouts though veggies least fresh whole thing devoid seasoning flavor also places serve kind sauce none huge hunk egg veggies also ordered almond soo gai fried within shade black chicken inside dry edible would guess frozen far long acquired freezer burn finally coupon free order chicken fried rice literally rice chicken peas sprinkled top flavor seasoning chicken dry dry rice oddly plump hard needless say try place clearly cutting corners freezing food get rotated frequently enough never bland oddly flavored food especially chinese food

we sat on down and ordered our food.  the meaties had the orange peel chicken, red curry chicken and honey walnut shrimp.  the veggies had pad thai and i'm not sure since i didn't really have anything from those selections.  the red curry was good, orange peel was decent and the walnuts in the honey walnut were over caramelized and got stuck in my teeth.

"First off, let me explain what the HELL I was doing at a horrible chain restaurant (I don't even feel comfortable calling this pre-fab big box pre-frozen place a ""restaurant""). I just started a job in Office Space near by on Elliot and needed a place I could get to, get served and get out within an hour with my friend on my dinner break. As we cruised Elliot, the lights blinking of Wal Marts, Costcos, JcPennys, and all the gruesome fast food chains like a garish consumerist Las Vegas, I decided on Chillis b/c at least their memory had not been horrendous. 

The last time I ate at one of these, it was TEN years ago-when I was 17. It was next to Borders Books in NJ, and I thought it was kind of sophisticated (hey, I had been brought up on Malls, okay?). 

The decor of this place confused me. The bar is right at the entrance with a supremely low ceiling. Seated at a tall table with some plush booths on the side and surrounded by five televisions, the waiter was fast with the iced teas. The bar was actually designed kind of cool, with beers in ice on the bar, kind of like the practice of picking out lobsters out of tanks. The drinks were disgusting looking (not our iced teas-they were fine-if served in PLASTIC beer mugs) in the menu, with all drinks mysteriously splashing and semen-resembling.

The decor...okay, there were also windows that looked out back into the restaurant...I mean I don't understand. Is it supposed to be bohemian? Like a ""mexican shack""? Country? The decor confuses me instead of comforts me. I feel like I am in a bad stage set of a western town, like a rompus room for tourist's kids or something.

We ended up with Southwestern Egg Rolls (which has like pureed chicken in it) and I did sneak a taste (yummy in the worst for you way-better than I remembered-but guarenteed to make my vegetarian stomach shrivel up and die) and the chocolate molten cake, which was OUT OF CONTROL. A fucking huge chocolate cake with hot fudge stuff inside a huge dent, with a large vanilla scoop of ice cream encased in a hard chocolate shell. 

These things were fine, standard, but expensive. Do people realize they are paying like 7 bucks for an appetizer and like 6 bucks for a dessert they could get a LOT more for their money at an independent ""real"" restaurant?

The stars go to the service-all nice, helpful, and not in a scary generic way.

"I came here with the family the day after Thanksgiving to watch some football. We ordered some boneless wings that were pretty good and Miller Lites that were on special for $3. The bartender/server seemed pretty annoyed to be working and wasn't very attentive, even though the place was empty. After we finished the wings we ordered some more food. This food was bad, a few burgers and some sort of soft taco plate. Nothing was good. 
The televisions are very outdated as well, no HD, flat screens, plasmas, or LCDs. Just small 20 inchers and some very large projection screens. The video quality was very poor, the projection screens were very washed out, to where you could barely view. The small TVs didn't have a clear picture. I would think if you advertise so much as being a sports bar as they do, the TVs would be up-to-date.

"I visited Dish 1st week of September. The one thing I realized about this place was how overpriced everything was. Breakfast burrito - $9? Grilled chicken that was laying out in the deli  (no sauce or condiments) $8? There is another place like Dish that sells the exact same chicken for $5. I order the pizza at the restaurant and it was a really salty. I should have just went to Domino's.

I really had a hard time believing the prices they are charging for a grilled sandwich (almost $10) to pasta. Are you kidding me? Then I realized I'm in Scottsdale where people will eat anything in front of them as long as that place looks trendy (see Olive and Ivy). 

The concept is pretty good. You can pick up stuff for home if you don't have time to make anything. I think the prices are restaurant prices for a take out place. 

I think the location of Dish will attract considerable traffic. It's a huge place that offers pick up and a sit down restaurant. Most of the employees knew what they were talking about and were friendly. But, it's vastly overpriced for what they offer.

Update 9/12/07: People have said that the food is pricey, but it's Scottsdale...so it comes with the territory. That's what's wrong with most people. Location should not justify the prices, the food should. Actually, I don't mind spending money if the food is worth it (in fact, my favorite local seafood restaurant is Wildfish, not inexpensive). 

But, the food is alright compared to the prices. If you're a bit lazy and can't make a sandwich yourself at home, then by all means..spend $10+ for a sandwich here.  I think this is definitely catering to the right crowd.  This place is a larger, overpriced LGO with marginal food. I've tried the pizza, grilled chicken sandwich, burrito, and sushi. All were OK.  Perhaps, I am fortunate that my client/work pays whenever I go there. I think there are other places I would go to spend my OWN money.

I think Dish will do well because of it's location and because it is Scottsdale..where most people don't have a discerning taste bud.  

One positive thing I will say is that it's a quick, easy place to get a meal and the employees seem knowledgeable about what they sell. So, if you're not in the mood to cook or even sure what to eat, but want a myriad of overpriced choices then Dish is for you. 

Again, this is a personal opinion. I'm not trying to offend anyone.",2,visited dish week september one thing realized place overpriced everything breakfast burrito grilled chicken laying deli sauce condiments another place like dish sells exact chicken order pizza restaurant really salty went domino really hard time believing prices charging grilled sandwich almost pasta kidding realized scottsdale people eat anything front long place looks trendy see olive ivy concept pretty good pick stuff home time make anything think prices restaurant prices take place think location dish attract considerable traffic huge place offers pick sit restaurant employees knew talking friendly vastly overpriced offer update people said food pricey scottsdale comes territory wrong people location justify prices food actually mind spending money food worth fact favorite local seafood restaurant wildfish inexpensive food alright compared prices bit lazy ca make sandwich home means spend sandwich think definitely catering right crowd place larger overpriced lgo marginal food tried pizza grilled chicken sandwich burrito sushi perhaps fortunate pays whenever go think places would go spend money think dish well location scottsdale people discerning taste bud one positive thing say quick easy place get meal employees seem knowledgeable sell mood cook even sure eat want myriad overpriced choices dish personal opinion trying offend anyone

"I've always wondered about this place and finally tried it out with a friend who has been before.

To begin, you should be coming here with a truckstop diner mentality. Don't expect a hipstery brunch joint serving chorizo bennies with a side of duck fat avocado fries (oh man, i don't know if that's even a thing but i want it to be now!) This is a truckstop diner in all its glory. Large portions, probably oversalted food, very efficient service (truckstop servers are my favourite for this reason), retro diner ambience (but not forced retro), and neverending coffee.

I got the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes, gravy, and steamed veg. Very salty, even for a sodiumphile like myself. Also tried the pierogies and sausage which were alright, as well as the hamburger steak.

Probably a great option for those lazy weekend mornings when you feel like going out for a huge, greasy, breakfast but don't want to line up with everyone else for the newest, cool, brunch place. +1 for credit card pay phones at some tables and the wall of stuffed husky toy animals at the front.",2,always wondered place finally tried friend begin coming truckstop diner mentality expect hipstery brunch joint serving chorizo bennies side duck fat avocado fries oh man know even thing want truckstop diner glory large portions probably oversalted food efficient service truckstop servers favourite reason retro diner ambience forced retro neverending coffee got chicken fried steak mashed potatoes gravy steamed veg salty even sodiumphile like also tried pierogies sausage alright well hamburger steak probably great option lazy weekend mornings feel like going huge greasy breakfast want line everyone else newest cool brunch place credit card pay phones tables wall stuffed husky toy animals front

"While John's (our server) performance was impeccable, I doubt we'll be returning any time soon. My crab cake was VERY fishy tasting and Tuesday's only offered a very blah cocktail sauce - no teriyaki, soy or other flavor masker.

Her mashed cauliflower (which she couldn't bring herself to insist I try) was ""not quite what I remember"".

Their batter is way too heavy for the sesame beef and general tao chicken. As if they used too much corn starch maybe? In both cases you get these hard lumps that are partially air filled and barely have chicken/beef inside. The sauce for both is also way too sweet. The sweet sugary taste overwhelms any other taste.

"The Good:
SO and I both ordered Unagi bowls. The unagi itself was good, and that's the only reason I gave this two stars instead of one. 
The Bad:
The veggies served with it were not great, and it did not come with miso soup, unlike all of their other ""bowls"". Also, it took an extremely long time to receive our relatively simple meals, around fifteen-twenty minutes. This was because he completely forgot about us and only remembered when my SO went up and to ask about the food. Moreover, he and I watched as the worker (probably also the manager) argued with a customer, saying that she had already received her food, when it was clear it was a different girl who happened to order the same item.

"The Cage aux Sports is to Quebec - what Hooters is to the Southern US. They are everywhere, the menu is the same and they are boring.

I'm no chef, but when I suggested that they substitute it for a hamburger bun and that I would be happy with that - she said the cook won't want to switch.

So I ordered a burger because they had a new menu with some ""specialty"" burgers. The patty was not fresh - it was the variety that you take from the freezer. Probably with grill marks already produced on them. It was not an enjoyable meal.

"Breakfast!!

Nothing to WOW about.
Although their Specialty Pancakes look impressive as hell.
There is a Notice that these meals (even omelettes) may require an 18min cooking time over your basic bacon and eggs. Just an fyi.

Party of one. No counter to kick back at. Bummer.
Great service though. They are all over you, and very nice. Monica was a sweetheart.
Especially with what the servers are contending with......and you too if you come here.

Tuesday morning 10:00am. Waited only 5mins for my table.
Once seated I'm surrounded by a couple screaming kids, several folks (who remember phonebooths)  chatting away about taking their garbage cans out, or having been to Phoenix already, etc., LOUDLY.
All the while ingnoring those right in front of them? I'm finding it sad that older people have discovered public use of a cell phone too. They make loud speaking people louder.

Food is certainly worthy here. Except maybe the $3 small orange juice. Maybe even the $15 total which includes a $2 tip. And can most certainly get higher. I had a simple breakfast.

Will I come again? Probably not as a party of one. With my folks, or a ""morning after"" episode of a fine romance? Majority rules will have to win that one.

Give me the Mom & Pop breakfast joint any ol' time versus a place like this or similar.

Before owner was changed, it was my go-to-place.
After then, forget it.

I and my wife were impressed with their cutlet combo so we became quite regular here for long time.
With our hefty complement over and over, we came here with my sister's couple and parents without knowing the owner changed meanwhile.
Ordered cutlet combo, which comes with pork cutlet, fish katsu and hamburger steak.
Then, got pork cutlet only so asked to correct it.

Don't be too surprised with what happened.

Waiter, who seems to be the son of owner, came back to me and asked whether I ordered correctly.
Wow, what an excellent customer service... 
Really impressed!

It wasn't the end of story.
That waiter (yeah, it was him again!) took our dishes with angry inhale.
He left pork cutlet outside while chef was preparing for other two missing kinds. When the dish was served, pork cutlet was really cold...
As owner and chef changed, the overall quality was really bad, too.

Service was slow to non-existent. meals were served without any cutlery and when I requested some, only I was supplied with any, my friend had to ask seperatly and wait even longer.

Food quality was terrible, the ham was poor quality and over cooked and while the fish wasn't as bad the batter wasn't quite restaurant quality.

That was the end of my dealings with Gabby but my friend went back the next morning to give it another chance. When he went to put cream in his coffee he found that the packet had expired and now half resembled cheese.

"The food is old, dry, and has no taste whatsoever. I work in the hospital. I have given this place several chances, and every time I come here I am incredibly disappointed with the food. The butter chicken has no flavour. I don't usually add salt to my meals. However, I had to add THREE packages of salt to my meal. That is crazy! The chicken legs looks incredibly dry due to sitting under the heat lamps all day. They should not appear to have wrinkles on the skin. My colleagues have bought the chicken legs for lunch, and the meat was stringy--not normal for chicken legs.

I was ordering 1/2 fries and 1/2 onion rings. Unfortunately, they no longer sell them this way. You would have to buy a side of fries and a side of onion rings. Therefore, they have lost my business forever.

The owners are fortunate that they get unsuspecting and new customers each day because it is a hospital. If their business were based on returning customers, they would go bankrupt very quickly. Also look at the lineups. There's lineups at Subway, Hero Burger, and Druxy's.

"This place is right up the street. I have never been before, and at this point I never will again. I ordered take out. Lasagna, a child size gnocchi, and chicken and rice soup. I ordered these based on what I found online. Basically good reviews. The lasagna was 5 layers of noodles, meaning noodle on top of noodle, under the 5 layers of noodles..yes, just noodles, was a thin layer of ricotta and another noodle. Nothing between the layers of just noodles, not even sauce. On top was some cheese baked golden brown, deceiving. The menu states meat sauce, 2 little flecks of meat is what I am looking at. I took 2 bites, and I stopped eating it. I went back to the kitchen to check the rest, thinking maybe I just got the end piece and the filling fell out. No. Next I try the gnocchi, chewy is an understatement. They were also hard. Not to confuse the al dente of the lasagna. This dish had one tiny piece of meat visible in the sauce. Smaller than a grain of rice. I didn't even try the chicken and rice soup yet, as I was so disappointed. I have never returned food, or even complained. I was hungry, and disappointed. I just called the place, and the women who answered told me I really should have called last night when I ordered. I picked up at 840p-845p. They close at 10. I should have called last night, because she can't do anything for me now. I don't want you to do anything for me, I wanted to express my opinion (something I never do) on how this food is not even edible. I was told I could call tomorrow when the boss (who I believe may be the cook) is in, but she can't do anything for me. Again, I stated I didn't want anything. I was told no one else ever complained about the lasagna. I said, according to what I found online (however most reviews are older) that is exactly why I ordered it, as I was thinking the same. The women up front were nice last night, today on the phone wasn't exactly the same. I am unsure if she just thought I was trying to get my items for free, or what the case was.

"15 miles from the Las Vegas strip this place claims to have Iowa Pork Tenderloin Sandwiches and since it's been more than 5 years 
since we had one we were determined to make the drive. When we arrived it looked very promising a large crowd was gathering next door for the car show and once we entered the place had a very cool atmosphere with 
TV's on every wall,classic 50's 
boothes and all kinds of car memorabilia. Plus 
theres a bar & game room upstairs. There was no wait & plenty of seating when we arrived at 6:00 pm. After we were seated , 20 minutes later a teenage waitress came to take our drink order, 20 minutes later she came back with the drinks and took our order. We ordered 4 sliders,Fried Cheese, Pork Tenderloin & Country Fried Steak Sandwiches. A little pricier than the menu we had found on the 
interent but still fairly reasonable. While we waited for our appetizer we saw several disgruntled patrons complaining about the slow service & leaving. After an hour of waiting we still had NOT seen our waitress for a refill or explanation. There were at most 30-40 patrons in the place at this time. The people sitting across from us had to have waited 20 minutes for there bill and finally a 
waitress brought them every unpaid check and asked which one was theirs, the man left exact cash for the check & voiced quite loudly to no one in particular he wasn't leaving any damn tip-for what? On 2 
occasions while we were waiting with our EMPTY glasses on the edge of the table as a CLEAR sign we needed MORE to drink the waitresses would turn tail and run before they made eye contact and had to DO THEIR JOB!! Finally fed up with waiting for NO APPARENT REASON we decided to give up and go somewhere that actually serves their customers. We approached the waitress to find out what the problem was she laughed & said ""it's crazy in here"" with no apology or explanation for the ABSURDLY long wait. HELL we've waited an HOUR to get into a place with NO problem but an HOUR to see your waitress after you've ordered-NEVER and we eat out 3-4 times a week! To say it was BAD service is an understatement. We never had a chance to try any of the food but without a doubt there was NO way it would have been good enough to compensate for the 
atrocious service. The only way I would recommend this place is if it were FREE & they were POURING booze down your throat while you wait.

"I am a complete fish lover.  Growing up that was my staple -- fish, all kinds of seafood, octopus, lobster, crab...I think you get the idea.

I had passed this place on the way home one night and vowed to see what it was about.  I checked out their website -- not too shabby!

Hubby and I decided to give it a go the other night.

What a disappointment.  I can't even articulate about how overcooked my food was or how meagre the service was.  I practically begged for water and silverware.

Words cannot describe how angry I felt when I left.  The food, the service, utterly disappointing.

I ordered their Cedar Plank Salmon.  The salmon was so overdone that the edges were past the point of crisp -- they were burnt.  I asked our server if I could please get one that was not quite so charred.  I swear she rolled her eyes at me.

The sides were the only highlight of that meal.  Hubby's meal was ""ok"" by his standards, but I could see a stream of resentment building in him.

It was a Thursday night, not too packed, but busy enough.  Our server was more concerned with her chatter with the other servers.  It's one thing to have friends at work, but you don't neglect the customer.  I saw that we were not the only ones who bore the brunt of her bad service.

When my plate came back, she slammed the dish down so hard that the salmon almost fell onto the table.

Surly much?

I can't give this place a good recommendation.  Their beer selection was ho hum as was their mixed drinks.

Not a place I would recommend for friends or out of towners.",1,complete fish lover growing staple fish kinds seafood octopus lobster crab think get idea passed place way home one night vowed see checked website shabby hubby decided give go night disappointment ca even articulate overcooked food meagre service practically begged water silverware words describe angry felt left food service utterly disappointing ordered cedar plank salmon salmon overdone edges past point crisp burnt asked server could please get one quite charred swear rolled eyes sides highlight meal hubby meal ok standards could see stream resentment building thursday night packed busy enough server concerned chatter servers one thing friends work neglect customer saw ones bore brunt bad service plate came back slammed dish hard salmon almost fell onto table surly much ca give place good recommendation beer selection ho hum mixed drinks place would recommend friends towners

"Went to a family event at Fuddruckers this week. Have a relative who digs it. Going there just gives me the willies. 

It definitely seems to have been cleaned up a bit from the last time we went. It was dirty, nasty the previous time. Little bit of solace in that. DIdn't seem as dirty. They'd reupholstered the booths with the torn vinyl. They'd gotten rid of the cracked & torn vinyl red & white striped tablecloths. Still cracked & old formica but it didn't seem as dirty.

As far as the food, I got a bacon cheeseburger that was just not very good. Ok, but nothing special at all. The fries weren't great either. In years past, I was a big fan of the plastic cheese in the heated cheese fountain but not so much either. After it cools a bit, it's just nasty.

I will go back when future family events require & maybe with less trepidation but I still wouldn't go there by choice with other good options nearby.",2,went family event fuddruckers week relative digs going gives willies definitely seems cleaned bit last time went dirty nasty previous time little bit solace seem dirty reupholstered booths torn vinyl gotten rid cracked torn vinyl red white striped tablecloths still cracked old formica seem dirty far food got bacon cheeseburger good ok nothing special fries great either years past big fan plastic cheese heated cheese fountain much either cools bit nasty go back future family events require maybe less trepidation still would go choice good options nearby

"I get my hair cut next door to this place and have thought about eating there a few times after I noticed their sign that says, ""Home of the best Cuban Sandwich in Charlotte,"" and finally did this afternoon after reading a couple of positive reviews about the place.

I have to say I was disappointed.

I have had a lot of Cuban sandwiches in my time, and have even gone so far as to roast my own pork, go to Compare's Foods for Cuban bread, and making my own (I'm a culinary student).  The sandwich at Carolina Grill has all the components -- the ham, the pork, the cheese, the mustard, pickle and Cuban bread -- but nothing was really very special.  My idea of a good Cuban has a meaty, chewiness to it -- thick slices of home-roasted pork, slices of good ham.

The ""roast pork"" here was, as the last reviewer said, some kind of pulled pork and not sliced.  In fact, it looked and tasted suspiciously like a commercial product of Carolina-style barbecue pork.  I noticed they have both ""Cuban Roast Pork"" and Barbecue Sandwiches on the menu, which makes me wonder maybe they started out using sliced roast pork and they switched to the barbecue.  The restaurant seemed a bit slow, and when places start cutting food costs because of that it is a vicious downhill cycle that leads to no good.  The ham also didn't impress -- the best Cubans I've had have ham that was cut from a chunk, like Honey Ham.  This place uses thin processed ham -- like the Danish baked ham that comes in rectangular plastic packages hanging next to the Oscar Meyers.  

I also had an appetizer of Ham Croquettes that were a frozen commercial product.  It wasn't bad, but I'd suggest the ""chef straight from Cuba,"" as one of the co-owners described, keep the box low so diners can't see it from the dining room.  Something like that tells me a lot about a place.  The chef has nothing to do in the afternoon slow period, but instead of making a batch of home-made croquettes from scratch to freeze (probably saving food cost too) he uses a commercial frozen product.

I think this place has the potential to be a good spot with home-made Cuban food, but they need to commit to making the food from scratch as much as possible instead of cutting corners with commercial products whenever they can.  And if they really want to push their Cuban Sandwich as the best (not a bad ideal at all), then they need to make it the best, starting with roasting the pork and using good ham.  More pickles woudn't hurt either.",2,get hair cut next door place thought eating times noticed sign says home best cuban sandwich charlotte finally afternoon reading couple positive reviews place say disappointed lot cuban sandwiches time even gone far roast pork go compare foods cuban bread making culinary student sandwich carolina grill components ham pork cheese mustard pickle cuban bread nothing really special idea good cuban meaty chewiness thick slices pork slices good ham roast pork last reviewer said kind pulled pork sliced fact looked tasted suspiciously like commercial product barbecue pork noticed cuban roast pork barbecue sandwiches menu makes wonder maybe started using sliced roast pork switched barbecue restaurant seemed bit slow places start cutting food costs vicious downhill cycle leads good ham also impress best cubans ham cut chunk like honey ham place uses thin processed ham like danish baked ham comes rectangular plastic packages hanging next oscar meyers also appetizer ham croquettes frozen commercial product bad suggest chef straight cuba one described keep box low diners ca see dining room something like tells lot place chef nothing afternoon slow period instead making batch croquettes scratch freeze probably saving food cost uses commercial frozen product think place potential good spot cuban food need commit making food scratch much possible instead cutting corners commercial products whenever really want push cuban sandwich best bad ideal need make best starting roasting pork using good ham pickles woud hurt either

The Caesar dressing might have a good flavor but was so dilouted with water that it poured more like a vinaigrette rather than a caesar - and no it was not  caesar vinaigrette - there was one item in the salad with flavor and crunch, that was the croutons - the greasy fat soaked croutons.

"I have lived within a half mile of this Carl's Jr. Store #1101078 for over 20 years. I was excited to live close to a Carl's Jr. as I loved their food when I lived in California.
The first 2 or 3 times it was a little less than ok, and thought it just was an off day for them. Unfortunately, the food never got any better, and the service was lacking. Ordered a Famous Star, drink, and Zucchini once and came to the window. Gave them a $20 and they gave me a couple bucks back. I said how much was my order? They said with the 4 order of zucchini.... what? I wanted 1 order.They said to come back the next day for a refund, as there were no managers at the store until the next day WTH! 
The place burned down about 4 yrs ago, and they rebuilt it. The family and I thought we would try it again since it was new and fresh after the rebuilt. I punish myself about twice a year at this store hoping that something has change, but always come out disappointed. 
I eat at Carl's a couple times a month, but this one I avoid.
My wife called and wanted chicken tenders and zucchini on my way home. So I was close to home instead of the one by my work, so I tried this store again.
My wife said the food seemed quite cold after the long wait for the chicken tenders, and started to eat.
The reason was the chicken was raw!, I'm not talking under cooked, I'm talking RAW CHICKEN.

On Monday night, October 30th, at 1:30 am, I arrived at this Carl's Jr. As I was driving up, I noticed a car reversing out of the drive though... uh-oh. 
I am a human being. I can completely understand that on a Monday night it would be dead. Not having any customers for hours, and the employees decide to close early and go home. I get it, not cool, but I get it. 
I was pretty upset that night though, as you could probably understand. I was going to leave a note so the openers knew that they had lost money by closing early. (Not that that was the best decision, but this is the story.) I was going to wedge it in the drive through window; as I touched it, it slid open about a half inch, even though it was still locked.
This noise, then prompted the employees, hiding in the back, to come see what it was. THE EMPLOYEES WERE THERE THE WHOLE TIME. The lights were off, they hadn't answered the phone when I called prior to coming, and they said nothing at the drive through intercom. They were shocked to see me standing outside my car. I held up my note for them, which called them lazy, and said something to the effect of ""I just want some food"". They proceeded to laugh at me. Well, I got one of them in a photo. 

To consumers reading this, I don't know what to tell you. Just don't hit this location after midnight I guess. I imagine this wasn't the first time, and won't be the last if they stay employeed here..

It's one thing to close early and go home, but to close early and just sit around at work in the dark?? Pathetic. And laugh at someone who is clearly hangry?! ... smh

To those girls, go apply at a place that closes at 8pm.. 

For the manager to help identify them:
The employees were presumably two females. The one who was able to dodge the photo was young, dark hair, with shorter hair in a pony tail, and shorter than 5'6"", and wearing make up. The one in the photo seemed to have a natural look, and also had dark hair. She seemed taller than the other girl. 

So to the manager here, your employees are taking advantage of you.",1,review employees food get came carl jr driving straight san diego also drove extra minutes hotel come double checked hours closed debated even wanted go way food monday night october arrived carl driving noticed car reversing drive though human completely understand monday night would dead customers hours employees decide close early go home get cool get pretty upset night though could probably understand going leave note openers knew lost money closing early best decision story going wedge drive window touched slid open half inch even though still locked noise prompted employees hiding back come see employees whole time lights answered phone called prior coming said nothing drive intercom shocked see standing outside car held note called lazy said something effect want food proceeded laugh well got one photo consumers reading know tell hit location midnight guess imagine first time wo last stay employeed one thing close early go home close early sit around work dark pathetic laugh someone clearly hangry smh girls go apply place closes manager help identify employees presumably two females one able dodge photo young dark hair shorter hair pony tail shorter wearing make one photo seemed natural look also dark hair seemed taller girl manager employees taking advantage
"This is really the tale of two bars.  

The positive is that drinks are cheap and the food is pretty good.  I've had few things in my stops there and I haven't been disappointed by food yet.  The wings are fantastic, the sandwhichs are filling, and the sides are tasty.  

I go here when i'm waiting my girlfriend to get home from work on mondays and the bartender monday sucks running.  She can't focus on more than one task at once and therefore is constantly flustered which makes for an uncomfortable air in the bar area. I've witnessed one of her meltdowns actually clear a pretty full bar.  Dear owner, this trainwreck is costing you money...you might want to consider upgrading staff.

The times she hasn't been there and a capable staffmember has been working has produced fun experiences.

"Bears living in the zoo eat fresher and higher quality food than this. 

I was saddened at how horrific this geriatric hot spot was, and I'm definitely not surprised that this place is now closed. 

Unfortunately I made the decision to try this place out. I have no idea why. 

My friend ordered a sandwich. That's pretty much all there is to say about it. He ordered a sandwich, ate it, and he immediately regretted it. 

I made the poor choice to select the unimpressive and soggy chicken alfredo pasta. It looked as though it had come from a can, a freshly opened can nonetheless, hence the one star. I couldn't eat it without the gag reflex setting in. 

The interior made me feel strange and awkward with wooden bear figurines, bad seating, fake foliage, doily tablecloths and hanging needlepoint pictures.

"While the place has an original menu, everything they serve ends up tasting the same in my opinion.  Perhaps it is because they offer only 2 bread choices, or in their way of cooking, but I just was not impressed by their sandwiches.  
I had their standard fries as well, and they used a seasoning that was not very complimentary to the sauces they served on the side.  I did enjoy the kettle chips that were included with the sandwich, but for nearly $10 a pop, I expect a bit more from a sandwich.",2,place original menu everything serve ends tasting opinion perhaps offer bread choices way cooking impressed sandwiches standard fries well used seasoning complimentary sauces served side enjoy kettle chips included sandwich nearly pop expect bit sandwich

"We ordered through the online service Just Eat. The order was for a combination dinner of won ton soup, orange beef, spicy peanut butter chicken, big shrimp with vegetables and spring rolls.

The order showed up exactly at the promised time.

Unfortunately, all of the food was luke warm and had to be reheated in the microwave.

The won ton soup had a plain broth - not very tasteful but the won tons themselves were good.

The spring rolls were excellent and were highlights of the meal.

The orange beef lacked any crispness even before being reheated and was in a dark brown sweet sauce that lacked any orange flavor.

The chicken fried rice was very dry and needed sauce from one or more of the other dishes to be edible.

the big shrimp and vegetables was very good. Decent sized shrimp and stir fried vegetables that were fresh and were flavorful.

The chicken in spicy peanut butter sauce was the mystery dish or the night. I think it was another dish altogether. The thinly sliced chicken was tender but the sauce was orange colored and greasy and there was nothing resembling peanut butter or spice (see photo).

There are many Asian restaurants on that particular drop of Decarie Boulevard.

I recognize you are a talented award winning chef. I love the Roaring Fork. However, I am wholehaeartedly dissapointed in what you've done to Pischke's - its just not Pischke's anymore at all.

Admittedly I was never a huge fan of the original, so maybe I'm not the most qualified to post the first review.

Maybe I made a mistake by not going with the burger or pastrami sandwhich (both looked really good), but nothing I had made much of an impression.

"I must agree with Scott S, but I should point out that I'm probably even less qualified to write a review of this place as I didn't eat here... I merely wandered in and right back out. 

Gone is the crowd and the long wait on a weekend morning waiting for a Pischke's greasy and tasty breakfast. Gone is the kitschy decor that gave the place character. Gone are the sassy waitresses who looked like they needed a good night sleep. Gone are the bursting menus full of good eats at reasonable prices.

Replacing all of this is a bland and boring decor, 50% fewer menu choices, and 50% higher prices. The place was pretty empty while every other breakfast place in the neighborhood (we drove past 5 others) was packed with a line going out the door. Here's a tip for Mr Robert McGrath - if you buy a successful restaurant, don't make drastic changes and jack up the prices... in other words - if it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

I'm actually kinda pissed too because I thought Pischke's was pretty good and it was definitely adding character to our city... what's there now is just another boring restaurant. There's plenty of those around here... Pischke's was unique to the area. When I visit my sister in Minnesota, she has some really neat breakfast places she takes me to that are decorated as an eclectic mess, but that blow you away with good greasy food and are dripping with atmosphere and fun. Same story when I go to San Diego or Long Beach to visit friends. Neat hip cities have neat hip breakfast joints. Well now we have one fewer. 

It's true - I haven't eaten here and perhaps Robert McGrath makes the most bomb-ass bacon and eggs this side of the equator... but it would seriously have to blow my mind to put this place back on my list of places to go. The empty seats told me the story anyway. Before I left, I told the hostess to put it back the way it was.

"Edit: Since I reviewed this place, it has become something else and I can no longer recommend it. I'll leave my original 4 star review in tact, but I'm taking away 2 of the stars to reflect the current state of the place - overpriced pretentiousness. I'm taking away one more star because they kept the name and ditched the no-brainer existing and working formula. My review of the new place is elsewhere here on Yelp. 

Here's my original review of the original restaurant - sad to see it gone:

Fantastic breakfasts - a little on the greasy side, but it's a neat little greasy spoon in old town Scottsdale. It belongs in Seattle or Minnesota really. It's certainly a favorable alternative to a breakfast at The Breakfast Club. The staff isn't quite as pretty (but so what?) and the food is a little bit more greasy (but it's oh so good). You don't have to get dressed up to go to breakfast like you do in some of the downtown scottsdale places which is nice. 

It beats going to Denny's and it's reliable for some good food... you can't go wrong here and the crowd is diverse and make for great people-watching. Sometimes it gets really busy, but the wait usually isn't too bad.",1,edit since reviewed place become something else longer recommend leave original star review tact taking away stars reflect current state place overpriced pretentiousness taking away one star kept name ditched existing working formula review new place elsewhere yelp original review original restaurant sad see gone fantastic breakfasts little greasy side neat little greasy spoon old town scottsdale belongs seattle minnesota really certainly favorable alternative breakfast breakfast club staff quite pretty food little bit greasy oh good get dressed go breakfast like downtown scottsdale places nice beats going denny reliable good food ca go wrong crowd diverse make great sometimes gets really busy wait usually bad
"This place was perfect before it was ""upgraded"". It was a simple, kitschy, affordable, little place that had heart. It was a Scottsdale legend... Tragedy struck the family recently. So. Instead of preserving what locals had come to love (obvious if you ever tried to eat here on the weekends), Mr. McGrath instead ""upgraded"" and turned a remarkable place into just another old town restaurant.

"Apparently Pischke's used to be a fun, personality-filled destination for yummy brunch, which is why my friend Aaron guided us there one early afternoon.

Unfortunately, since Aaron's last visit, changes have been made.

Now Pischke's is a bland eatery with a rather uninspired, limited menu positioned at the aspirational eating price point. As far as I can tell Pischke's target customer is well off older people who are looking for unchallenging options and prices high enough to keep out the riff raff.

Pischke's no longer serves daily brunch, so we had lunch on our visit. Among our group of six, not one of the dishes stood out in a positive way. The burger and salads were average. The crepes were decent but small and nothing special. The pork verde was fine, but inexplicably served with buttered flour tortillas. The pot pie was atrocious-- a ""deconstructed"" take on the typical comfort food it consisted of a large bowl filled with extremely bland pot pie filling, topped by a thin layer of philo dough flakes. It was devoid of everything (taste, crust) that makes a pot pie good.

The food was complimented by very poor service. Our waiter was totally smarmy and condescending, my drink order went unfilled, and when the food was served the waiter had coded the seats wrong so every single meal was placed in front of the wrong person.

Highly unimpressive. While Phoenix may not be known as a fine dining destination, there are plenty of great restaurants in the area to patronize instead. Don't waste your calories, time or money at Pischke's.",1,apparently pischke used fun destination yummy brunch friend aaron guided us one early afternoon unfortunately since aaron last visit changes made pischke bland eatery rather uninspired limited menu positioned aspirational eating price point far tell pischke target customer well older people looking unchallenging options prices high enough keep riff raff pischke longer serves daily brunch lunch visit among group six one dishes stood positive way burger salads average crepes decent small nothing special pork verde fine inexplicably served buttered flour tortillas pot pie atrocious deconstructed take typical comfort food consisted large bowl filled extremely bland pot pie filling topped thin layer philo dough flakes devoid everything taste crust makes pot pie good food complimented poor service waiter totally smarmy condescending drink order went unfilled food served waiter coded seats wrong every single meal placed front wrong person highly unimpressive phoenix may known fine dining destination plenty great restaurants area patronize instead waste calories time money pischke

"Hugely Disappointing!!  Based on all the other reviews maybe they were have an off night?  We already decided not to give it a 2nd try.....

We were seated and given menus but waited a good 10 minutes for them to come back for drink orders.  Then we waited a good 15 minutes for our dirty Kettle One martini's to come and waiting to order.  While we were waiting as patiently as we could the waiter takes the full order (drinks, apps, meal) of the couple who were seated 15 minutes after we arrived! Of course I would be understanding on the wait if the place was packed but there were only 5 tables filled in the entire place!!

We finally ordered and the watier came back 3 different times to clarify what we ordered.

The complimentary bread finally arrived along with our drinks, which by the way were terrible and in filthy (spotty, lipstick stained, crusty).  The bread was really great though so I started to have hope.

From the App's the Scallop and Goat cheese was great- the duck and mushroom was bland.

Main meal of pork chops and sea bass were boring. 

Oh when we got the bill they only did Well Martini's- would that have explained the poor taste or do they just not know how to make?

"Without a doubt the worst Chinese restaurant in Cleveland . The restaurant is located in an old McDonald's building barely fitted for a sit down restaurant.  

I ordered an egg roll - it was average - mustard and ketchup containers used for hot mustard and sweet and sour - cute. 

I ordered walnut chicken - a ""new"" menu item - it was horrible. I was expecting something fast fried in a brown sauce and stir fried with honey walnuts. What I received was a pile of ""white"" fried chicken with a flavorless sauce and some walnuts thrown in. It tasted like cornstarch -the sauce had absolutely no flavor - I would have added soy sauce, but I don't need the extra sodium and there might not have been enough in the restaurant to spice it up.   

The service was extremely friendly and very attentive - so much so that I couldn't bring myself to complain about the food.  I simply asked for a carryout container, boxed it up, and threw it out at my hotel.  

It was really cheap though - $15.00 for entree and egg roll.  I was on my expense account, so it didn't bother me to go somewhere else to eat that night.  

But do yourself a favor - this place is not good.  Ignore the internet reviews.

"It's amazing how things can go so wrong.

On a 9 a.m. visit, the first thing I noticed was that this shop offers soups, sandwiches, and salads.  I wasn't in the mood for typical breakfast items. I asked the attendant whether they were serving sandwiches.  I even pointed to sandwiches on the menu.  No, he replied, only breakfast items (bacon, sausage, or ham and egg croissants or bagels).

You can't nuke a croissant.  My $4 croissant was no better than a cheap Jimmy Dean frozen sausage croissant from the grocery store. It came with coffee that was nothing special. I pumped the coffee from dispensers that ran dry.  You get better coffee from 7-Eleven.

I noticed servers standing around the soup and salad area.  Out of curiosity, I asked if they were serving soup and sandwiches.  Yes, they serve soup, salad, and sandwiches all day.

I asked the attendant who helped me at first.  ""I thought you said you weren't serving sandwiches.""
   ""Oh no.  We serve them all day!""

What can you do?  I spoke English and apparently he understood it.  What went wrong is anyone's guess.  My first experience here was highly negative.  It's a nice shop, however.  The attendant was friendly and pleasant. Maybe the misunderstanding was somehow all my fault.

"sick...and not in the way my college roommate use to say ""that's sick! "" (meaning cool, awesome, sweet, wicked (variation of any of the previous). No this was just gross. 

After driving across town to two different malls to find a particular dress in my size, I worked up quite the appetite. Hey it's Friday- I'll go for some Americanized Asian...so I ordered the general Tso's with a maki roll ( not sushi- this is what they call their spring rolls), and noodles.

My noodles were cold...like really cold. The portion was beyond stingy- normally with these kind of take-out restaurants I cannot finish my meal, but their were exactly 11 pieces of chicken 7 of which were teeny-tiny bits... The texture of both meat and noodles was very mushy and overall not so tasty. When I paid with debit the girl at the counter literally handed my receipt and said ""sign-this"" ...so much for service. I will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible. 

I should have known better than to give into mall food cravings...not worth the calories.

Today it was overly greasy, and lacking any flavor. A little salt and pepper added during cookie by go a long way FYI.

"UGH.........
I stopped by the deli today to grab a sandwich for lunch.  Not many other places in this area to eat so I thought it to be a good choice.  WRONG!!!  So I bought a chicken salad sandwich on a salt bagel and it looked so delectable but as I was eating it I heard a little voice from my tummy - 'not good'.  I just thought that maybe I was disappointed that the sandwich looked so good but didn't taste as good as it looked.  However, 30 minutes later I felt the BBG's (bubbly gut) and off to the toilet I ran.  Soooooo embarrassing when you're stuck in the bathroom at work for half the day.  To make matters worse, my co-worker offered to run to the drugstore to buy me some Kaopectate.  Yeah...not my finest hour.

"Preface: I live in the Bay Area now, and I don't know many Pittsburgh restaurants beyond Primanti Bros.  Further, I booked a dinner at this ""Kitchen and Wine Bar"" before I knew that my companions were not in a wine mood.  Anyways...

The good news is the service and ambiance were excellent.  All of the servers were friendly and attentive, and the decor was modern yet soothing.  They knew where I could park without feeding a meter and without getting a ticket -- try getting that info on the Embarcadero!

Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the food.  The salmon tartare was very fishy - mostly the salmon ""caviar.""  The saffron rice (sidenote: are you afraid to call it risotto because you're in Aspinwall?   (a) don't be; and (b) then call it very creamy round grained rice, apparently cooked in broth) was so salty that I actually asked myself if I had done something to offend the chef.  He couldn't have meant for it to be this salty, unless he recognizes me from 7th grade study hall or something (and if so, put away the salt shaker and come out of the kitchen --  I haven't forgotten either!)  The short ribs were soft but not as soft as they should be.

Final note: they offered me a free dessert, which was a nice enough touch that I might actually go back, in the hopes that I just caught the chef on an off night.  Hmmm.

"I am not surprised that I am the first to review.
I must also disclose that this will be one the few times that I will write a review based on ONE visit - I normally like to visit at least twice but I would like to live to see another day, and I'm afraid that may not happen if I go there again.

Background: me and few friends had been eyeing this spot for a while; but it gave an eerie feeling and we never ventured. Believing in the power in numbers and in the spirit of adventure, 3 of us went - apparently that was not enough.

The decor? non-existent.
menu? well, most were not available but regular pub food. We got burgers and onion rings and pitcher of beer. I will say that was the crispiest rings ever!made me miss Harvey's onion rings very much. Hamburgers were bland and had a home-made quality, definitely filling. The BLT sandwich was just that: bacon, lettuce, tomato between toasts - nothing else....for $4.

Based on the above, I would have returned except, things got weird. 
The crowd there - sketchy at best (but in that weirdly frightening way- not in the Parkdalian kinda way ), is what would prevent the second visit.

People were watching us, music turned out loudly and someone on his way out to pee(I'm told), stopped behind my friend and gave me a look. A few minutes later, my friends who are born and raised in the small town ways, strongly advised that i finish the beer - and I did as I was told.
As we left, someone half way followed us and another man started screaming - and the staff were nonchalant and indifferent about a mini-fight or the strange group of people just hovering the counter; they weren't going to help us if anything happened.

So.
If you are feeling brave and adventurous, this is where you go. Otherwise, Ronsey is filled with other joyful spots than this, where you don't feel life threatened.",1,surprised first review must also disclose one times write review based one visit normally like visit least twice would like live see another day afraid may happen go background friends eyeing spot gave eerie feeling never ventured believing power numbers spirit adventure us went apparently enough decor menu well available regular pub food got burgers onion rings pitcher beer say crispiest rings ever made miss harvey onion rings much hamburgers bland quality definitely filling blt sandwich bacon lettuce tomato toasts nothing else based would returned except things got weird crowd sketchy best weirdly frightening parkdalian kinda way would prevent second visit people watching us music turned loudly someone way pee told stopped behind friend gave look minutes later friends born raised small town ways strongly advised finish beer told left someone half way followed us another man started screaming staff nonchalant indifferent strange group people hovering counter going help us anything happened feeling brave adventurous go otherwise ronsey filled joyful spots feel life threatened

So I brush it off I mean this is cleveland and good service is almost impossible here.  I order about 50$ worth of food for me and my children and was told the wait time would be 45 minutes so after about 2 hours I call and ask what is delaying our food and again get treated like an inconvenience by yet another employee.  I guess they were so busy they had to have the owner come in and help ( I was under the impression being busy was a good thing) so I spoke to this owner George who I served many times at my previous restsraunt and he assures me that my food will get to me hot and delicious well let's just say when it got to me it was anything but. My wafer fries were cold and disgusting and my cheese sticks were cold as well (yum). Go figure lol. Well before we got off the phone George told me my next order would be discounted.

So I order buffalo wings hoping the food might just arrive before my hubby has to leave. 45 minutes pass and guess who calls back? yep you guessed it they have no wings either.

Wow I almost list it but I am a mother trying to set the right example so I ask if the owner could kindly call me back. (oh yeah I end up canceling my order ) when he finally calls me he said that 8 his own words "" he cannot find good help in the ghetto"" and that he will not do anything because he simply does not care. I believe him about not caring because it was quite evident in his tone and verbal demeanor.  He also argued with me saying he never offered me any discount .

The presentation of pastries here was underwhelming, nothing ""looked"" good, and the decor was subpar (I'm not a big decor guy, but it does leave an impression).  

Der Brokorb is a small tucked away bakery and sandwich place in Woodchester mall.  A selection of freshly baked breads ($3 per loaf) lines the wall behind the counter which has a small selection of pastries, homemade cookies and desserts.

I stopped by for breakfast, but not a whole lot looked especially appetizing. The only thing that quirked my interest was this chocolate almond cookie thing  ($1.50, see the picture), but it wasn't very tasty. There wasn't another person in the place, so I'm questioning whether turnover is a problem and how fresh the pastries are.


Individual apple pies ($3 each), homemade cookies ($3 per box) looked fairly average.

On the positive side of things, when I walked in through the door I was hit with the smell of freshly baking bread so maybe their breads are pretty good. I wouldn't mind trying a sandwich, but the pastries and cookies didn't leave a good impression.

"I noticed the spelling is off, rather than Queen Creek it is called Qween Creek in the title. However it came up because I searched for Olive Mill. 
When we first got to the place the 'tour' was highly recommended by the person receiving us at the door. 
My poor rating is due to the totally over priced COMMERCIAL which is called a 'tour' and basically has you seated in a small outdoor tent like structure to give you a 5 minute history lesson about the owners who bought the 'farm' in 1998 and a small lesson on how the olives are harvested. Either with a vibrating rake manually or a machine, depending on how closely the trees are planted. The majority of the time is taken up with giving a video demo of the same info the young tour guide rattled off and then giving a commercial about the spa the wife runs and the many uses for olive oil. 
I can give you the tour right here, right now for free. 
Olive oil goes well with chicken and fish and salads. Now repeat this 4 or 5 times and you've got the tour. Also if your olive oils go rancid, feel free to use them for skin care. Funny- I use mine for skincare before it goes rancid. 
The tour DOES NOT INCLUDE a tour of the olive grove. 

    I told 'Emily' who called herself an assistant manager that the place was really nice but the tour was an overpriced commercial and left us feeling disappointed. My daughter who took us out payed $28 for the tour and was left not being able to afford the wine she would have loved to buy.

The food was yummy, over priced and more of an appetizer portions than a dinner meal. 
In the end the tour was the disappointment that stuck with us and I will Not recommend this place to my relatives who come out to visit in the future.

"Braddock Hills sub shop shut down

May 7, 2016 8:13 AM
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
The Braddock Hills restaurant Rudy's Submarines has been ordered closed following a series of violations, the Allegheny County Health Department announced this morning.

On Thursday, the restaurant's health permit was suspended because it lacked a certified food protection manager, had neither a handwashing sink in the food preparation area nor hot water and soap, and had no date-marking equipment. Counters were not properly cleaned and sanitized, and the floor and ceiling were in poor condition, according to the Health Department.

On Friday, the Yost Boulevard eatery was found to be operating in spite of the closure order. So a second order has been issued, and a red closure placard placed on the front door.",1,braddock hills sub shop shut may pittsburgh braddock hills restaurant rudy submarines ordered closed following series violations allegheny county health department announced morning thursday restaurant health permit suspended lacked certified food protection manager neither handwashing sink food preparation area hot water soap equipment counters properly cleaned sanitized floor ceiling poor condition according health department friday yost boulevard eatery found operating spite closure order second order issued red closure placard placed front door

2. Our food took 30 min to get done (we were the only ones in there).

I stopped in for breakast on my way to Home Delay (Depot, for the uninitiated).  I was in and out in half an hour, and that was all it took to remind me why it's been so long since my last visit.  ""Under New Management"" does not always mean ""Our food doesn't suck anymore.""

My coffee actually turned grey when I added cream.  I had all-day breakfast, with ""Museum"" sausage - a term borrowed from a neighbour I ran into on my way out - dried and wrinkly, like a mummy.  My eggs over easy had soft, liquid yolks (good) and soft, liquid whites (bad).  Potatoes were tasty, though what else does one expect when they actually ooze butter?  Finally, the rye toast wasn't very flavourful.  Not sure how that happened.

Star #2 is for the service - I was served in a prompt and friendly fashion by the new owner (of about a month).

Not sure how one quesadilla and two sopes came out to $29. The ingredients they use tasted super low quality. Their refried beans with the cheap cheddar cheese they use to garnish, just makes you want to throw up after looking at itt. I'm so upset I wasted my money eating here. Another thing that completely pissed me off, is my 2 year old son saw saltine crackers on their picture to accompany the ceviche. I asked if I could have just the saltines for my son. The rep. said she doesn't have any -- that those are old and outdated pictures, understandable! So, I asked if I could have a few chips for my boy instead. She said I have some for sale for $3. I just spent almost $30!!! You couldn't add complimentary chips, like other Mexican places do?! Jesus. And to top It allllllll off, my stomach hurts 30 minutes after eating those Sopes.

"I wanted some good fish last Friday, 9/25/2019. I asked a very close relative, whom lived in the Iredell Cabarrus area, she said Lake Todd food is good, off Hwy 3, but She stated she didn't feel comfortable dining in there, she didn't explain why, so myself and husband drove from Charlotte to check it out. I wanted to dine  in, so my food would be fresh and hot, 
When we arrived we wasn't greeted properly, maybe they didn't know any better, but that was our first time at their restaurant.I am A very  bold liberal person, in which,  I feel every race creed and color should be treated equally. I didn't feel that in the atmosphere at all, when myself and husband sat down, of course we had to find our own seats, in which is ok, but it seem like everyone in there, even the youths act if they had seen someone from out of space. Very unfriendly atmosphere, to the point we had to get up and leave, without ordering. I am from this area grew up and was raise in this area and lived in this area until I got Married, I have a lot to say, but this isn't the platform to voice it on, but if you don't want to welcome or eat with any other race other than the white race, you should have a sign that says for whites only. I grew up when it was signs like that in Iredell, Cabarrus, Catawba, Rowan, Lincolnton, and Union counties, there are plenty others, but these are the counties where I visit or lived at.  As A young lady I fought hard behind the scenes to make it a better place to lived and work in that area for all race,  til the point my father stated I had  to leave town , because they had Labeled as a Black Militant, and it wasn't safe for me to live there , being a  young country girl , I asked him what did that meant,  and he explained it to me. I couldn't tell no one what he shared with me , so at 17 years of age I moved to Charlotte to live with an Aunt until he told me it was ok to come back. When I went to that Fish Camp it took me back to the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s . I can't apologize for this review ,  I am not telling anyone not to go there, but this is what happen to myself and my husband...and if it has happen to anyone else, speak up,,,,,Think about it!!!
No I will not recommend or go back there to eat, And I have white and black African Americans friends...",1,wanted good fish last friday asked close relative lived iredell cabarrus area said lake todd food good hwy stated feel comfortable dining explain husband drove charlotte check wanted dine food would fresh hot arrived greeted properly maybe know better first time bold liberal person feel every race creed color treated equally feel atmosphere husband sat course find seats ok seem like everyone even youths act seen someone space unfriendly atmosphere point get leave without ordering area grew raise area lived area got married lot say platform voice want welcome eat race white race sign says whites grew signs like iredell cabarrus catawba rowan lincolnton union counties plenty others counties visit lived young lady fought hard behind scenes make better place lived work area race til point father stated leave town labeled black militant safe live young country girl asked meant explained could tell one shared years age moved charlotte live aunt told ok come back went fish camp took back ca apologize review telling anyone go happen husband happen anyone else speak think recommend go back eat white black african americans friends

"Reusing mason jars is cool, reusing French fries is not! The fries for our steak came in two colours, fresh fried ones and another darker colour. The darker one after looking at it carefully, the very salty taste of the fries, and the crumple look of the darker fries we concluded it was deep fried already before. Maybe leftovers from previous diner? 

The way too salty taste of the fries spread to the steak as well. It was barely edible, which was a shame because it was a perfect medium rare.

We also order the 1 lb chicken wings because according to other reviews say it was fall off the bone goodness. We got it grilled because it was healthier. This too was also disappointing. These were the most tasteless wings I have ever put in my mouth. My girlfriend had to take it home and put some soya sauce on it. Yes very Asian.

The overall ambiance was nice with the reclaim wood wall and the glass doors. The waitress was new and was friendly. She was confused when I replied that the steak and fries were too salty. But if I just wanted nice ambiance and good service I would have went to the museum!
